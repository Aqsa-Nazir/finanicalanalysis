<html><body><p>After a tumultuous start to 2022, conditions have become even more turbulent for <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>) on the regulatory front. Earlier this morning, the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition Market Authority (CMA) announced investigations into possible antitrust activity between FB and <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>). While the probes are separate from each other, the agencies plan to work together to determine whether FB and GOOG conspired to limit competition on GOOG's Open Bidding platform.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways from this development:</p><ul><li>At the heart of the matter is a 2018 agreement between GOOG and FB that was code-named "Jedi Blue."&nbsp;Of concern is whether this pact -- which FB and GOOG say was publicly known -- led to the exclusion or restriction of competing ad tech services. <ul><li>More specifically, investigators are focusing on Audience Network's participation in GOOG's Open Bidding platform. Owned and operated by FB, Audience Network allows advertisers to promote products and services beyond the Facebook platform, creating revenue opportunities for outside publishers. </li></ul></li><li>According to Margrethe Vestagar, Executive Vice President of the European Commission, the agreement between GOOG and FB may have resulted in the weakening and exclusion of a competing service to Open Bidding. In particular, the allegation attests that the two companies prevented the uptake of header bidding services, which allow publishers to compare bids from multiple advertisers at the same time.</li><li>This is not the first time that this Jedi Blue agreement has caught investigators' attention. In fact, GOOG and FB are already under investigation in the U.S. for this very reason, after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton rounded up fourteen other states to sue the companies.</li><li>As with any governmental investigation, it could be years before any resolution comes about from these cases. However, if either company is ultimately found guilty of breaking antitrust laws, the consequences could be significant. A negative finding from the EU investigations alone could cost up to 10% of the companies' global revenues.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In the meantime, this development adds just one more overhang to an ever-increasing list for FB. About one month ago, <em>Bloomberg </em>reported that FB may pull Facebook and Instagram from Europe if it's unable to keep transferring user data back to the U.S. FB later refuted that story, but the article highlighted a major risk emanating from the Irish Data Protection Commission's preliminary finding that the transfers of data should be suspended. A final determination looms on the horizon with FB anticipating a decision as soon as 1H22.<br><br>Combine these increasing regulatory risks with the <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy changes, and increasing competition from social media platforms like TikTok and <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>), and it's understandable why FB is getting hit harder than GOOG is today. FB is simply in a more vulnerable position, while GOOG has displayed resilience and strength over the past several quarters, making it more equipped to absorb a negative headline.&nbsp;</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
