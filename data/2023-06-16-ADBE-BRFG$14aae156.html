<html><body><p><strong>Adobe (ADBE +2%)</strong> is higher today and is trading above $500 for the first time since February 2022. The catalyst is a strong Q2 (May) earnings report last night. We had concerns about a possible sell-the-news reaction given the +40% move in the stock over the past month. However, investors are pushing the stock even higher today. Mega cap tech names like Adobe have been very strong recently. </p><ul><li>This digital document giant has now posted three consecutive double digit EPS beats following four small beats, so that is a good trend. Adobe also posted nice revenue upside and guided EPS above analyst expectations for both Q3 (Aug) and FY23. </li><li> Its Digital Media segment performed well with revenue rising 10% yr/yr (+13% constant currency) to $3.51 bln. This was nicely above prior guidance of $3.45-3.47 bln. DM is by far Adobe's larger segment, so people watch it closely. Adobe's other major segment is Digital Experience, which allows businesses to manage/track customer experiences using analytics. DE segment revenue grew 12% yr/yr (+14% CC) to $1.22 bln, which was in-line with $1.21-1.23 bln prior guidance. </li><li> <strong>Adobe is particularly excited about Firefly</strong>, its family of creative generative AI models. It was recently released in beta version and has been attracting tremendous customer interest as it's highly differentiated in the market. It's being directly integrated into product workflows. Firefly's first model is trained on Adobe Stock images and licensed content designed to generate commercially viable, professional quality content. Adobe said customer generations from Photoshop were 80x higher than Adobe had originally projected going into the beta. In terms of top of funnel, Adobe thinks Firefly will help it reach billions of new users because it makes the act of creating more accessible. </li><li><strong>In terms of its macro view</strong>, Adobe says overall demand is strong and win rates remain healthy. However, as it enters the second half of the fiscal year, it is seeing some projects being pushed out in the current enterprise spend environment. The company has reflected this in its updated annual targets. Investors do not seem too concerned about this as we think they sort of expected some cautionary language. This language strikes us a bit less severe than we are hearing from others. </li><li> Adobe also gave an update on its pending acquisition of Figma. Adobe continues to engage with the CMA in the UK, the EC and DOJ as they conduct their regulatory reviews. Adobe continues to believe the transaction should close by the end of 2023. </li></ul><p>Overall, this was a very good quarter for Adobe. We had some trepidation going in following the big run in the stock. However, a strong report from <strong>DocuSign (DOCU)</strong> last week made us feel a bit more confident. Also, it was good to see Adobe raise FY23 EPS guidance by more than the Q2 upside. That overshadowed any stated concerns about the macro picture. A lot of tech names have warned about longer sales cycles and deals getting harder to close with more layers of scrutiny. Adobe seems to be humming right along.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
