<html><body><p>Few companies have benefited more from the powerful secular trend towards eCommerce than digital payments pioneer<strong> PayPal</strong> (<strong>PYPL</strong>). The company, which was spun-off from <strong>eBay</strong> (<strong>EBAY</strong>) in July of 2015, has experienced a burst in growth, fueled by a strong and steady march of new users to its platform during the pandemic. While store closures and government-imposed business restrictions steered many people to PYPL's services, there was some concern that PYPL's growth would hit a wall once economies began to reopen. Following the company's impressive 1Q21 report and enhanced FY21 guidance, that worry is largely being put to rest today.<br><br>In fact, it appears that momentum is only building. Bolstered by the addition of 14.5 mln net new active accounts, Total Payment Volume (TPV) surged by 50% to $285 mln compared to 39% growth last quarter. Underpinning the robust growth is an economic recovery that is spurring stronger consumer spending, including in international markets. Notably, Cross Border Trade (CBT) was up 44% to $48 bln with TPV strength seen in key European corridors, including intra-European corridors such as U.K. to EU.&nbsp;<br><br>People aren't just increasingly using PYPL to make online purchases. The company's person-to-person payment app, Venmo, also continues to generate stunning growth. True to recent form, Venmo volume jumped by 63% in Q1 to $51 bln, essentially matching Q4 and Q3's growth of 60% and 61%, respectively.<br><br>In addition to the ease-of-use, convenience, and general rising comfort levels of using Venmo, the app received another boost on April 20 when PYPL announced the launch of crypto on Venmo. Users can now buy or sell four types of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash), which aligns with the interests and activities of many existing Venmo customers. In fact, according to a&nbsp;Venmo Customer Behavior Study, more than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing crypto or equities, 20% of which started during the pandemic.</p><p>What's really remarkable about PYPL's performance is that the company is generating high-double digit growth despite ongoing weakness in the travel and events categories. Once travel returns to pre-pandemic levels and event and sports venues are at full capacity, PYPL should seize on another catalyst. Perhaps this factor was one element behind the company's increased guidance for FY21.&nbsp;<br><br>Specifically, PYPL now anticipates full year revenue growth of 20% versus its prior outlook of 19%, equating to revenue of $25.75 bln. On the bottom-line, EPS is forecasted to increase by 21% to $4.70, up from its original projection of 17% growth. The improved revenue and earnings guidance is supported by a positive revision to PYPL's net new active account guidance, which was nudged to 52-55 mln from 50 mln.<br><br>The main takeaway is that the feared slowdown that would accompany the reopening of brick-and-mortar businesses is not coming to fruition. To punctuate that premise, CEO Dan Schulman stated,&nbsp;'We now believe the shift to consumer digital behavior is going to remain essentially unchanged in a post-Covid world.'</p><br><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
