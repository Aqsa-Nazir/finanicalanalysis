<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN -5%)</strong> is under pressure today following its Q4 earnings report last night. As we stated in our preview, we had several concerns heading into this report. Revenue rose 8.6% yr/yr to at $149.2 bln, which was above the high end of prior guidance of $140-148 bln, and it was nicely above consensus. The guidance was slightly disappointing with the mid-point of Q1 revs below consensus, while Q1 operating income guidance of $0-4 bln was generally in-line with street estimates. </p><ul><li>EPS included an investment loss in Rivian. As such, the more important metric for profitability is operating income, which at $2.737 bln was above the mid-point of prior guidance of $0-4 bln. It is frustrating that AMZN does not provide an adjusted EPS number, but that makes the comparison to operating income all the more important. It's a clean apples-to-apples comparison as the investment loss is below the operating income line. </li><li> On the retail side, Amazon says customers remain cautious about spending. Customers spent less on discretionary categories and shifted to lower-priced items and value brands in categories like electronics. However, they continued to spend on everyday essentials such as consumables, beauty and soft lines. Early Prime Day in October and the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday holiday weekend outperformed expectations as customers responded to millions of deals. Third party sellers remain a key contributor and they comprised a record 59% of overall unit sales in Q4. </li><li>As we said in our preview, <strong>MSFT's weak Azure result made us nervous for AWS</strong> and that turned out to be the case. Revenue (constant currency) growth rates continue to slow in recent quarters: +20% CC in Q4, +28% CC in Q3, +33% CC in Q2, +37% CC in Q1, +40% CC in Q4 last year. Also, segment operating margin fell to 24.3% vs 29.8% last year and 26.3% in Q3. </li><li> Starting back in the middle of Q3, Amazon saw its AWS growth rate slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending. As expected, these optimization efforts continued into Q4 and the company expects they will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. In January, AWS revenue growth was in the mid-teens. The weakness is across all industries, with particular weakness seen from mortgage companies that are seeing lower volumes. Companies involved in crypto and advertising are also spending less. The silver lining here is that its new customer pipeline remains healthy. </li><li>The one positive surprise was maybe its Advertising Services segment, which held up fairly well. It posted +23% CC revenue growth to $11.56 bln. That is generally in-line with recent quarters: +30% CC in Q3, +21% CC in Q2 and +25% CC in Q1. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, the concerns we mentioned in our preview came to pass for the most part. </strong>The retail operations held up fairly well, but AWS was a problem area. With Azure coming up short, most expected a weak AWS number and we got it. But we think what is really spooking investors is that comment about <strong>mid-teens AWS growth in January. That was a bit of a Yikes! moment, at least to us</strong> and portends continued slowing growth in Q1. We also think the stock had gotten a little ahead of itself (+34% YTD), so people are using this as a reason to book recent gains.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
