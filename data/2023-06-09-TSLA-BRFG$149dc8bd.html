<html><body><p>The good news keeps pouring in for <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>), which is trading at its highest levels since early October of last year, with the stock receiving yet another boost  courtesy of <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>). About two weeks after rival <strong>Ford Motor</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) reached an agreement with TSLA that provides its EV customers with access to Tesla Superchargers, GM announced a similar deal with TSLA last night. Specifically, the partnership will allow GM's EV drivers to use 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across North America starting in 2024 in a move that market participants are viewing as a win-win situation.<br><br>For TSLA, the benefit of these agreements with GM and Ford is two-fold.</p><ul><li>First, and most importantly, providing GM and Ford access to its Superchargers will likely give it an insurmountable lead in the race to establish an industry standard for charging. Currently, there are two primary charging systems in the market: the North American Charging Standard (NACS) design that TSLA has adopted, and the Combined Charging System (CCS) used by GM, Ford, and other EV makers.</li><li>Initially, GM customers will need to use an adapter to access TSLA's Supercharger stations, but beginning in 2025, the company's EVs will be built with a NACS inlet, removing the need for an adapter. </li><li>With GM and Ford switching over to the NACS connector design, TSLA's charging network will significantly expand while likely ultimately becoming the single standard. A more robust charging network across the country will make TSLA's vehicles even more marketable, reducing customers' concerns about inadequate charging options on the roadways.</li><li>Second, TSLA will generate substantially more revenue from its Supercharger stations. In 3Q23, Services and Other Revenue, which includes paid Supercharging fees, increased by 44% to $1.8 bln. <ul><li>Although the Services and Other category only represented about 8% of TSLA's total revenue in Q3, that percentage should increase as GM and Ford EV customers begin accessing its charging stations. </li><li>For some context, GM has said that it will have the capacity to build 1.0 mln EVs in North America by 2025, while Ford is targeting a 2.0 mln EV run rate by 2026.</li></ul></li></ul><p>From GM's perspective, the upside of partnering with TSLA is that it will instantly and significantly expand the charging network for its customers, without having to invest in the buildout of its own system. CEO Mary Barra commented that collaborating with TSLA "knocks down a possible barrier to car buyers, some of whom worry about adequate charging" on the roads.</p><p>The main takeaway is that this agreement with GM is another big win for TSLA, amplifying a bullish sentiment that has defined the stock over the past month. Earlier this week, it&nbsp;was reported that all trims of the company's Model 3 sedan now officially qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, following a report from <em>Electrek</em> on May 25 that TSLA's Model Y became the world's best-selling car. Looking further down the road, the upcoming launch of the Cybertruck later this summer could represent the next catalyst for TSLA.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
