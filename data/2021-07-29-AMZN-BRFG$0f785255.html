<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN) </strong>is set to report Q2 results today after the close with a call to follow at 5:30pm ET. AMZN typically reports at 16:01-03 ET, so investors need to be on their toes. The CapitalIQ consensus calls for a +19% yr/yr increase in non-GAAP EPS to $12.24 from $10.30 a year ago. Revenue is expected to grow 29% yr/yr to $115.1 bln, current guidance is $110-116 bln. AMZN typically guides for revenue and operating income for the next quarter. </p><p>Operating income is a metric that's closely watched. AMZN has previously guided to Q2 operating income of $4.5-8.0 bln, but AMZN tends to be conservative with this metric. Q2 operating income consensus is $7.80 bln while Q3 consensus is $8.18 bln. </p><p><strong>There is a lot going on this quarter:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>On July 5, Andy Jassy officially became CEO</strong>, replacing Jeff Bezos, so this will be his first earnings call at the helm. Maybe we get some minor change in strategic direction, but we doubt it. We expect smooth sailing and little change because he's a long time insider. If anything, perhaps it's a boost for the AWS segment since Jassy had been CEO of AWS since its founding in 2003. The transition reminds us of Bill Gates stepping down as CEO at <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> in 2000 but remaining as Chairman. </li><li><strong>Amazon held its Prime Day during Q2</strong> (Jun 21-22), so that could add a nice boost to revenue. </li><li><strong>In late May, Amazon announced it will acquire privately held MGM</strong> (the movie studio, not the casino) and its iconic lion roar for $8.45 bln. This was AMZN's second largest acquisition ever, behind Whole Foods a few years ago, so it's a big deal. We will be looking forward to comments on the call relating to what this means for its streaming tv strategy. </li><li> <strong>In early July, the Department of Defense cancelled its $10 bln cloud contract with MSFT.</strong> Amazon had filed a lawsuit disputing how that contract was awarded. Amazon and Microsoft will both submit proposals. </li><li><strong>AWS is a critical growth engine for Amazon</strong> and it's an important part of how investors evaluate Amazon overall. AWS segment sales in Q1 rose 32% yr/yr to $13.50 bln vs +28% in Q4 and +29% in Q3. Its main rival, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, reported robust +51% growth JunQ, up slightly from +50% in MarQ. Investors will want to see AWS perform well. </li><li><strong>Advertising revenue within both the North America and International segments accelerated</strong> nicely during Q1. Higher traffic generally has been a large driver here, but it's also internal improvements like deep learning models to share more relevant sponsored products. Investors will want to see continued growth here. </li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
