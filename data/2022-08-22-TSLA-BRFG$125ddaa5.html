<html><body><p>During <strong>Tesla's</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) Q2 earnings conference call on July 20, Elon Musk commented that the price of FSD (full self-driving) technology would go up "sometime later this year." That time has now arrived with the cost of FSD increasing to $15K in North America, starting on September 5, according to a tweet by Musk.</p><ul><li>After starting the year with a price tag of $10K, TSLA bumped FSD up to $12K in January. This latest increase coincides with the release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, which Musk has touted as a major step forward for the software. Specifically, the new FDS version reportedly has improved pedestrian protection and is better at making unprotected left turns.<ul><li>It's important to point out, though, that FSD does not provide full autonomous driving. In fact, it only qualifies as a Level 2 driver assistance system, meaning that it can control two functions -- steering and accelerating/decelerating.</li><li>Unsurprisingly, TSLA has been accused of false advertising with the California DMV recently filing a lawsuit against the company.</li></ul></li><li>Meanwhile, the company's Autopilot system, which is a step down from FSD, is under investigation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) following a spate of recent crashes. According to a report by NHTSA, there have been 273 crashes involving TSLA's advanced driver assistance systems, more than any other EV maker by a wide margin.</li><li>The troubles don't end there. On July 13, TSLA announced that its Director of AI, Andrej Karpathy, stepped down. Karpathy led the computer vision team for the Autopilot product. That development followed news from a couple weeks earlier that TSLA cut its Autopilot staff by 200 positions at its San Mateo, CA office.</li></ul><p>Although it's been a very bumpy ride for TSLA's autonomous driving ambitions, developing self-driving vehicles remains a top priority for the company. In his typical dramatic fashion, Musk recently stated that TSLA's ability to charge more for FSD is the difference between the company "being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero." That statement is rooted in Musk's vision of developing software that's capable of supporting EVs that actually are fully self-driving. If TSLA succeeds and does produce a driver-less vehicle, than the software alone would be worth billions to the company. <br><br>According to Musk, TSLA's first fully autonomous vehicle will be a robo-taxi that will be mass-produced at the new Austin, Texas plant. The vehicle, which will not have a steering wheel or pedals, is expected to reach volume production in 2024. Of course, like other Musk timelines, this one is far from set in stone. In the meantime, TSLA will look to cash in on software updates and price increases. With Musk claiming that FSD is "ridiculously cheap", customers and investors can anticipate more price hikes down the road. Based on the stock's negative reaction today, though, there may be some concern about customer push-back on those price hikes, especially given the pre-existing affordability concerns for EVs.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
