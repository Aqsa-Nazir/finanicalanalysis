<html><body>A challenging set-up faced <strong>Netflix </strong>(<strong>NFLX</strong>) heading into the company's Q2 earnings report. Expectations for a strong performance were sky-high, as illustrated by the ~20% rally since its Q1 report on April 21. Stay-at-home orders and a lack of other entertainment options outside the house fueled robust subscriber growth in Q1 (+15.7 mln) and investors expected more of the same in Q2.<br><br>NFLX did post impressive net new subscriber adds of 10.1 mln in Q2, easily surpassing its guidance of 7.5 mln. The problem is that the company expects this pandemic-fueled surge in new subscribers to cease. <br><br> CEO Reed Hastings warned about this issue last quarter, stating, "We've had an increase in subscriber growth in March. It's essentially a pull forward of the rest of the year. So our guess is that subs will be light in Q3 and Q4 relative to prior years because of that..."<br><br>Considering that the stock still advanced sharply higher following Mr. Hasting's cautious comments, it appears that investors were hoping that the impact from the pull-forward would be minimal. It did not play out that way, though, as NFLX issued weak Q3 net new subscription guidance of 2.5 mln, falling well short of analysts' 5.0 mln expectation. <br><br>It's worth noting that NFLX has a tendency to "low-ball" guidance in order to manage expectations. However, even if NFLX comfortably exceeds its Q3 new subscriber outlook, the sequential drop-off would still be steep.<br><br>Adding to the concern is that COVID-19 has essentially shut down production of new content. Since content is created well in advance of when it's aired, NFLX is in relatively good shape for this year. Next year, though, could be quite thin for original content, which could weigh on new subscriber growth.<br><br>The silver lining is that lower content production and marketing expenses pushed NFLX's operating margin higher by 770 bps to 22.1%. Lower-than-expected costs also helped NFLX generate healthy free cash flow of $899 mln.<br><br>The substantial lift in margins shouldn't be viewed as the start of a longer-term trend because content creation will remain core to NFLX's strategy.<br><br>On a related note, NFLX announced last night that Ted Sarandos will become Co-CEO alongside Hastings. The promotion can be viewed as a nod to NFLX's commitment to developing new content as Sarandos was the company's head of content. <br><br> A natural inference is that Sarandos is being groomed to eventually take the reins, but Hastings quashed that assertion, stating, "To be totally clear, I'm in for a decade. This is two of us full time."<br><br>After a stellar start to FY20, the new CEO team will have their work cut out for them going forward as the stay-at-home growth catalyst diminishes. Limited new original content and strong competition will make it challenging for NFLX to retain some of its new subscribers. Still, the company is a well-oiled machine that is likely to bounce back relatively quickly from this set-back.<br><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
