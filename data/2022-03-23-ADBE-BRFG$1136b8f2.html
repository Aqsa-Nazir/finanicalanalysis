<html><body><p><strong>Adobe (ADBE -8%) </strong>is not off to a great start in FY22: the digital document giant reported just a modest beat for Q1 (Feb) and issued downside guidance for Q2 (May). During the pandemic, Adobe benefited as companies and consumers embraced digital document creation and launched digital storefronts. Entire industries had to pivot nearly overnight to digital-first operations. However, growth has begun to slow through the past couple of quarters. </p><ul><li><strong>The company reported </strong>EPS and revenue upside in Q1, but its beat was much smaller than is typical for the company. Also, the company issued downside guidance for next quarter for the second time in a row. A year ago, Adobe was consistently guiding higher, so this is a notable change. Weakness in Europe due to the conflict in Ukraine factors into ADBE's outlook. </li><li><strong>Speaking of the guidance, Adobe did not provide annual guidance </strong>like it did last quarter. Maybe we can infer that there was no change, but Adobe did not explicitly reaffirm its outlook. This may be spooking investors. On the call, management did say that it expects quarterly sequential revenue and EPS growth in Q3 and Q4, but specifics were not provided. </li><li><strong>Digital Media</strong>, Adobe's largest segment, which is comprised of Creative and Document Cloud, saw revenue grow 9% yr/yr to $3.11 bln, a bit better than prior guidance for +8% growth. However, it was still a notable drop from +21% growth in Q4 and +23% in Q3. The silver lining that Q2 guidance calls for improvement, forecasting growth of +13%. Adobe has been lapping tougher comps, but the overall trend is nevertheless discouraging.</li><li><strong>Adobe's other big segment is Digital Experience</strong>, which allows businesses to manage/track customer experiences using analytics. Segment revenues grew 13% yr/yr to $1.06 bln, exceeding prior guidance for +11% growth but also declining from Q4's +23% growth. As in the DM segment, a bit of a rebound is expected in Q2; guidance calls for +15% growth. </li><li> <strong>Looking ahead, Adobe will be implementing a new pricing structure</strong> starting in late Q2, its first real change since 2017. This should act as a tailwind in 2H22. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, </strong>Adobe blew away analyst expectations for much of the pandemic. However, its back-to-back modest beats and downside guidance are worrisome. Adobe, like certain other software companies that gained traction as a result of the pandemic-induced acceleration of remote and digital work, such as document creator <strong>DocuSign (DOCU)</strong>, may be feeling its results pressured by the combination of lapping its pandemic boom while encountering improved conditions for in-person meetings and in-office work. </p><p> <strong>We are a bit surprised that the stock is taking such a hit today</strong> given that it had already fallen from near $700 in November to $466 yesterday. We would have expected the bad news to be priced in already. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
