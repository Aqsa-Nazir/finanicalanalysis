<html><body><p><strong>PepsiCo's (PEP +3%) </strong>Q3 results were no small potatoes as the beverage and snack food mammoth delivered its second-straight double-digit earnings beat in Q3. PEP also hiked its FY22 earnings and organic revenue growth forecasts, underscoring the resilient demand for its brands despite inflationary headwinds plaguing both PEP and its consumers. PEP is now targeting EPS of approximately $6.73, up from $6.63, and +12% organic sales growth yr/yr, up from +10%. The company also increased its core constant currency EPS estimate to +10% growth from +8%. </p><p>After PEP reaffirmed its FY22 guidance last quarter, it signaled that adverse foreign exchange (FX) impacts and elevated inflationary levels would likely linger. Therefore, today's raised outlook suggests that there may be light at the end of the tunnel. PEP offered a few encouraging remarks on that front, such as predicting commodity inflation to stabilize around the high teen percentage. </p><p> Still, PEP was tempered in its remarks. The company cautioned that the environment is clearly still very inflationary, with supply chain challenges across the industry. However, the numerous highlights from Q3 illustrate PEP's ability to navigate these tricky waters successfully. </p><ul><li><strong>Sales growth was broad-based</strong>. Aside from the Asia Pacific region, which saw organic sales climb just 8%, every other region grew at a double-digit clip. As a result, organic revs surged 16.0% yr/yr. Meanwhile, reported revs, which include FX and acquisitions and divestitures impacts, grew nicely at 8.8% to $21.97 bln. </li><li>A large part of the sales growth stemmed from PEP continuing to take price where it could. Still, despite this, <strong>volumes held up nicely</strong>. PEP's Convenient Foods business did register a 1.5% volume decline yr/yr. However, it was lapping slightly unfavorable +4% growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, PEP's Beverages business saw its seventh-straight quarter of volume growth, expanding the figure by 3% yr/yr in Q3. </li><li> Furthermore, even though volumes in Europe slid, with convenient foods dropping 5% yr/yr and beverages giving up 8%, given how challenged the region is, with a war in Ukraine and soaring energy costs, the single-digit declines were a testament to the strength of PEP's brands in the region. </li><li> Lastly, PEP noted that its <strong>market share is either holding up well</strong> (in the case of beverages) <strong>or seeing accelerating gains</strong> (in the case of Frito-Lay snacks).<ul><li>  On a side note, PEP's Beverages market share holding up shows that rival <strong>Coca-Cola (KO)</strong> may be experiencing similar demand resiliency, a good sign ahead of its Q3 earnings report on October 25.</li></ul></li></ul><p>  Bottom line, PEP's Q3 results illuminate that strong brands, which command relatively low elasticity, can thrive during an inflationary environment. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that KO and <strong>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) </strong>each reported similar upbeat results as PEP last quarter. As such, PEP's solid numbers in Q3 are a good sign for its rivals ahead of their Q3 reports in two weeks.    </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
