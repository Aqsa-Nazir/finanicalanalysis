<html><body><p><strong>Pure Storage (PSTG +5%)</strong> bounced back in a flash today after it announced a partnership with <strong>Meta (FB) </strong>to provide storage capabilities for the social media giant's AI supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC), which is planned to be built out by the middle of this year. PSTG checked all the boxes to be FB's likely choice in its development of the RSC, especially given that FB is already a customer of PSTG, and PSTG helped design FB's AI research infrastructure in 2017. PSTG also boasts many other tech giants as customers, including <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> and <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>PSTG is a flash-storage array and data management services provider that enables cloud providers, enterprises, and governments to operate their data across most cloud networks, like AWS and Azure. PSTG also offers subscriptions, with IT support and promised upgrades down the road. </p><ul><li> By focusing on a combination of hardware and subscription-based software, PSTG has delivered impressive sales growth. For example, PSTG posted back-to-back quarters of over 20% revenue growth yr/yr in its last two quarters. Revenue growth is climbing back to pre-pandemic levels of consistent 20%+ growth each quarter.</li><li>  Earnings have climbed right along with the solid sales growth, even though rising supply chain costs have taken a bite out of gross margin, which fell 60 bps yr/yr to 68.5% in Q3.</li><li>  Despite the decline in margins yr/yr, PSTG still boasts huge margins, especially compared to its competition. For example, <strong>Dell Technologies (DELL)</strong>, which also sells all-flash storage arrays, commands margins of only 33%. Additionally, <strong>IBM (IBM)</strong>, another all-flash array provider, boasts gross margins of just 46.4% as of Q3. </li><li> PSTG sells to over 50% of Fortune 500 companies; it grew its customer base by 12% yr/yr in Q3 to a total of over 9,500 total customers. </li></ul><p>Overall, PSTG's expansion of its partnership with FB to provide storage capabilities for its new supercomputer is fueling the storage provider's solid boost during a market that continues to see a broad sell-off, particularly in tech. However, despite the gain today, PSTG shares are still down nearly 30% from all-time highs posted in late December. Even with the stable stream of revenue that comes from its subscription-based services, PSTG is still a high-multiple tech stock, and that space is experiencing uncertainty in a rising interest rate environment. Therefore, although we like the company's expanded partnership with FB, as it shows the strength of PSTG's competitive advantage, the stock, by still trading at over 40x FY22 earnings, could continue to experience selling pressure. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
