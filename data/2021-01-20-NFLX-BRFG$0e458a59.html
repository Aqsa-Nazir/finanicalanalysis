<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX +14%) </strong>is clearly wearing The Crown today. The streaming giant is trading sharply higher today after reporting impressive Q4 results last night. The company's EPS tends to include unusual items, making it tough to compare results to consensus, and that was the case again in Q4. Revenue was generally in-line with analyst expectations. NFLX also guided well above consensus for EPS and revs in Q1. </p><p><strong>However, the EPS and revenue numbers were not the main story today. </strong>The most important operating metric is global streaming net adds. After missing prior guidance in Q3 and with NFLX raising prices in Q4, we were not quite sure what to expect this quarter. Our concerns were a bit overblown: Q4 net adds came in at +8.51 mln vs prior guidance of +6.00 mln. That's up sharply from +2.20 mln in Q3.  </p><p><strong>The one chink in the net add armor is that Q1 guidance is perhaps being seen as a bit light at +6.00 mln. </strong>Q1 tends to be a sequentially higher quarter than Q4, so the sequential decline may raise some eyebrows. However, we think it's pretty good guidance when you dig into it. Recall that 1Q21 is lapping a massive +15.77 mln net add number from 1Q20, when the pandemic started. That was NFLX's largest net add quarter for 2020, so +6.00 mln is a good number, especially given the price increase.  </p><p>In terms of other important metrics, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU keeps growing at $13.51 in Q4, up from $13.40 in Q3. ARPU had taken a dip in 1Q20 due to a heavy dose of free trials, but that metric is growing again; it appears that NFLX was able to convert many of those free trials into paying customers. </p><p> <strong>Operating margin was another bright spot</strong> at 14.4% vs 13.5% prior guidance due to higher-than-expected revenue. Also, NFLX guided to robust 25.0% operating margin in Q1. <strong>Net adds are grabbing most of the headlines today, but we think this margin guidance should be getting more attention</strong>, as it really shows how Netflix's greater scale is being leveraged on the bottom line. For all of 2020, operating margin was 18% vs 13% in 2019. For 2021, Netflix is now targeting 20%, up from prior guidance of 19%, due to a more favorable revenue outlook.  </p><p>Another reason the stock is surging today is because Netflix said it believes it's very close to being sustainably free cash flow positive. For 2021, Netflix expects FCF will be around break even (vs. prior guidance for -$1 billion to break even). Combined with an $8.2 bln cash balance and $750 mln undrawn credit facility, Netflix believes it no longer has a need to raise external financing for day-to-day operations. Netflix will also explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks. </p><p><strong>Bottom line, the big net add number and the strong EPS/revenue guidance are the main reasons for the stock's gains today. We think smart investors are also looking at that operating margin guidance</strong>, and Netflix's comments of not needing external financing for day-to-day operations is music to investors' ears. Investors were nervous heading into this report after Q3's net add miss, but Q4 was a pleasant surprise. Finally, the stock had been range-bound in the $450-550 range since July, but this report seems to be a catalyst to propel the stock out of that range and could lead to further upside.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
