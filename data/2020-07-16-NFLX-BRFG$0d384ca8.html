<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX)</strong> is set to report Q2 results today after the close with a video call to follow at 6pm ET. Current CapitalIQ consensus for EPS is $1.83 and for revenue it's $6.08 bln. In April, NFLX guided to EPS of $1.81 and revenue of $6.048 bln. NFLX typically beats analyst expectations. It had reported upside to EPS consensus for eight consecutive quarters, but NFLX did miss in Q1. </p><ul><li> <strong>The most important metric with NFLX is global streaming net adds </strong>and most people are expecting a huge number. In Q1, it came in at a whopping 15.77 mln, more than double its January guidance (pre-pandemic) of 7.00 mln. Clearly, more people staying at home led to a bunch of new subscribers.  </li><li>Netflix's current guidance for Q2 global streaming net adds is 7.5 mln, <strong>but many people think that's too conservative.</strong> NFLX did say last quarter that its huge Q1 streaming net add number may have been partly due to a pull-forward from future quarters. It will be interesting to see how these cross currents play out. Regardless, all eyes will be on the Q2 net add number and we think there is a good chance it comes in ahead of guidance. </li><li><strong>Another metric to watch is ARPU.</strong> The jump in Q1 membership additions also affected ARPU for its UCAN (US &amp; Canada) region. After rising sequentially each quarter in 2019, it dipped to $13.09 in Q1 from $13.22 in Q4. The free trial period hurts revenue per user but ARPU should go back up in Q2 when NFLX will get revenue from these new accounts. So that will be something to watch. </li><li><strong>On the content front, NFLX said last quarter that almost all filming had been stopped</strong> due to the pandemic, with the exception of a few countries like Korea and Iceland. A slowdown in new content later in 2020 and 2021 could hurt net add growth down the road, so we'll be watching to see to what extent production is back up and running. </li><li><strong>Bottom line, the stock has been a monster, going from $300 in mid-March to $533 currently. </strong>Clearly, investors are expecting the stay at home orders to have resulted in big subscriber growth again in Q2. However, any chink in the NFLX armor, could result in a pullback in the stock. (PVIEW)</li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
