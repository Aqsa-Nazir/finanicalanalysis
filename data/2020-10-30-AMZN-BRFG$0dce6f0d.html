<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN -4%)</strong> had another strong result with its Q3 earnings <a bhref="https://www.briefing.com/InPlayEq/NewsFeed/newsdoc?id=760341" target="_blank">report</a> last night. It reported a huge beat-and-raise plus its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment did quite well. AMZN says its Q3 results largely reflect the continuation of demand trends it saw when it exited Q2, with strong demand and sales growth across all major product categories, including online grocery sales which continued to accelerate. Also, Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. </p><p>Non-GAAP EPS was much better than expected ($12.37 vs consensus of $7.36) because the extra volume led to operating leverage and higher margins while revenue rose a robust 37.4% yr/yr to $96.14 bln vs the $92.56 bln consensus. What jumps out at us is that a company this large is still able to post 35%+ growth, which is remarkable. </p><p> <strong>So why is the stock lower?</strong></p><ul><li> AMZN's Q4 operating income guidance of $1.0-4.50 bln was a good bit shy of consensus of $5.69 bln.  <ul><li>We're not overly worried about this because AMZN guided lower for Q2 and reported nice upside as AMZN tends to be conservative. However, with the huge volume expected in Q4, we would have expected a better number. </li></ul></li><li>AMZN is growing its fulfillment and logistics network square footage by 50% this year. <ul><li> The problem is that some of this expansion shifted a few weeks and will happen in Q4 rather than Q3.  </li><li>Once new buildings open, they take time to ramp up and become 100% efficient. This loss of productivity will act as a short-term headwind to profitability in Q4.  </li></ul></li><li>The company added a lot of new employees in Q3 (250,000 permanent full-time and part-time) and has already added about 100,000 more in the first month of Q4. <ul><li> We suspect there will be productivity losses as they train that many people. </li></ul></li></ul><p>This was another robust quarter for AMZN. Unfortunately, some higher costs in Q4 are taking the shine off the good results for Q3. Expectations were already running very high, so any chink the armor was going to impact the stock and that's what happened. However, AMZN's decision to increase capacity by 50% this year and hire 350K employees tells you all you need to know in terms of management's bullish outlook going into 2021. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
