<html><body><p><strong>eBay (EBAY +4%) </strong>breaks out of its recent consolidation after posting earnings and sales upside in Q1. The online auction platform also topped its prior Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) target and showed further signs of active buyer stabilization. Meanwhile, although EBAY has not yet returned to providing full-year guidance, its Q2 outlook was reasonably cheerful, projecting adjusted earnings in line with consensus and revs ahead of consensus.</p><ul><li> Revenue growth of 1.1% yr/yr to $2.51% outpaced GMV growth by roughly 5 pts primarily due to advertising; first-party ad products grew 27% yr/yr. Adjusted EPS of $1.11 represented a solid 9.9% jump yr/yr and marked a wider beat than EBAY posted last quarter.</li><li> EBAY's attention to its "focused categories," which include a host of products, ranging from automotive, refurbished, luxury, and collectibles, remains the underlying factor behind its solid sales growth. During Q1, focused categories outgrew the rest of the eBay marketplace by around 8 pts, expanding by low single digits yr/yr. Focused categories will remain a core component of EBAY's long-term playbook, outlining during its 2022 Investor Day that by the end of 2024, these categories will cover half of its business. <ul><li>An interesting side note, EBAY's refurbished GMV accelerated notably during Q1, delivering double-digit yr/yr growth. Given the stubborn inflationary pressures, consumers may turn to refurbished alternatives instead of buying new products, benefiting EBAY -- which offers a robust refurbished program with money-back guarantees -- over the near term. </li></ul></li><li>Although EBAY's active buyer counts remained in decline yr/yr and sequentially, slipping 7.0% and 0.7%, respectively, the metric hovered around the same number as last quarter, falling just 1.0 mln to 133 mln in total. This was a similar theme that played out in Q4, signaling that after five-straight quarters of sequential declines, active buyers may finally be finding a bottom.</li><li> EBAY's Q2 guidance was decent, carrying over much of the positive momentum from Q1. The company expects adjusted EPS of $0.96-1.01, meeting analyst expectations, and revs of $2.47-2.54 bln, exceeding estimates. EBAY's GMV outlook was slightly more deflating, forecasting $17.8-18.2 bln, translating to another yr/yr decline. <ul><li> Also, since Q4, EBAY has not seen any discernible change in the underlying macro environment. </li></ul></li></ul><p>EBAY's solid Q1 results reflect a moderately healthy end consumer and a viable alternative to the many retail and e-commerce giants competing for a share of consumers' increasingly squeezed wallets. EBAY's report also sets an upbeat tone ahead of competitor <strong>Etsy's (ETSY)</strong> Q1 earnings slated May 3. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
