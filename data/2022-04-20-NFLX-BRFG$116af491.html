<html><body><p>For the second quarter in a row, shares of <strong>Netflix (NFLX -36%)</strong> have taken on water following the company's release of quarterly earnings. In the wake of the sell-off that followed the release of the Q4 report in January, we figured that a lot of the bad news had been priced in already. However, in its Q1 report, Netflix shocked investors by reporting its first global net add subscriber decline in over a decade and guided to an even larger decline in Q2. </p><ul><li><strong>The net add decline stands out </strong>in shocking fashion. Global streaming paid net adds in Q1 were -0.20 mln vs +2.50 mln prior guidance, and the guidance calls for -2.00 mln for Q2. NFLX stopped service in Russia, which did nip the net add number. If not for its suspension of service in Russia, the company would have recorded +0.50 mln paid net adds. However, that total still would have been a miss. </li><li> <strong>We give NFLX credit for its candor during the call.</strong> Management admitted that it misread the impact of the pandemic. COVID boosted subscriber growth a lot in 2020 and 2021. At the time, NFLX thought those results mostly represented pull-forward demand. However, coming into 2022, that thesis does not really hold. After years of downplaying the threat of competition, NFLX has changed its tune in the last two quarters and has admitted that competition has had an impact. </li><li> <strong>NFLX also views account sharing as a significant factor in its performance. </strong>Account sharing among users of the streaming service is not a new phenomenon. However, when NFLX was growing fast, it did not view taking measures to address the practice as a high priority. That is now going to change. NFLX estimates that over 100 mln households are sharing. In NFLX's view, it is great that those users love the service, but NFLX knows that it needs to monetize their usage, and doing so will be a key near-term focus. How exactly that will happen is not settled yet, but it is going to be addressed. </li><li><strong>The other big news on the call </strong>was NFLX's indication that it is now open to offering lower priced ad-supported plans. NFLX has long avoided even thinking of this as an option. We view it as a good move, as it should allow NFLX to attract a new set of customers for whom paying $20/month for the platform is too much. </li></ul><p><strong>These last two earnings reports suggest that the streaming market has become saturated,</strong> especially in the US. We may need to substantially reset our expectations for Netflix going forward. As subscribers become harder to come by, investor focus may shift from net add numbers to overall revenue and cash generation. Netflix enjoys huge advantages with a large subscriber base that has long been the envy of the streaming world, and that is before dipping down into the ad-supported world. </p><p> <strong>We give Netflix credit. It was an early pioneer with streaming</strong>, and while many doubted its business model early on, NFLX stuck to its guns, and the bet paid off handsomely. However, a bunch of others are now joining the streaming party, and their presence is having an impact. In some ways, the NFLX story reminds us of <strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong>, which was also early and right in its category, EVs. However, we think that by 2030, EVs will become commonplace, and its advantage will wane. But that's a story for another day.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
