<html><body>After reporting that Q3 vehicle deliveries surged by more than 70% yr/yr to 241,300 units, it seems that <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) is nearly immune to the chip shortages that are plaguing the auto industry. The impact of those shortages and supply chain issues was on display last Friday when <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>) disclosed that its Q3 deliveries plunged by nearly 33%. This stark contrast in performance begs the question: how is TSLA managing to navigate around these constraints while other auto OEMs are struggling mightily to keep all of their plants running?<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">To answer that question, we turn back to TSLA's Q2 earnings conference call in late July. During that call, CEO Elon Musk commented that the company was able to substitute the semiconductors that were in short supply with alternative chips and then rewrite the firmware to maintain production. While Musk didn't mention this factor, it also appears that China-based electric vehicle (EV) makers aren't being hit as hard from the chip crunch as are other manufacturers.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">For instance, after only marginally cutting its Q3 delivery guidance in late September, <strong>Li Auto</strong> (<strong>LI</strong>) reported on Friday that deliveries soared by 103% yr/yr to 7,094 units. Even more impressive, fellow Chinese car maker <strong>XPeng </strong>(<strong>XPEV</strong>) posted September delivery growth of 199% for a quarterly record of 25,666 vehicles.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">On a related note, many of the semiconductors used in auto manufacturing are produced in Malaysia, which is obviously much closer geographically to China than it is to the U.S. Therefore, the logistics are less complicated in terms of shipping to China. Also, the Chinese government has made EV production a top priority, as illustrated by its mandate on automakers calling for 40% of all sales to be EVs by 2030.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Whatever the exact insulating factors are, they are certainly having a major positive effect on TSLA. The company's Shanghai factory isn't missing a beat, with the successful ramp up of its Model Y SUV providing a boost to its record Q3 deliveries. <br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">TSLA isn't completely out of the woods, though. In addition to supply chain challenges, an energy crisis is gripping China as the country grapples with blackouts and skyrocketing coal and natural gas prices. Consequently, the Chinese government has implemented strict energy consumption policies, which has forced some factories to halt production. In fact, on September 27, <em>Nikkei</em> reported that Eson Precision Engineering, a parts supplier for <strong>Apple </strong>(<strong>AAPL</strong>) and TSLA, suspended production at one of its facilities for five days.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Back in the U.S., TSLA's highly-anticipated Cybertruck launch has been delayed until late 2022, after a late 2021 launch had originally been projected. Volume production isn't anticipated until about a year later, a time in which GM's all-electric Cadillac LYRIQ pickup will also be hitting the market. <br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The main takeaway is that the global chip shortage that's wreaking havoc across the auto industry is non-existent in TSLA's delivery numbers. Year-to-date, TSLA's deliveries have nearly doubled to 627,000 vehicles, demonstrating the company's exceptional resilience.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
