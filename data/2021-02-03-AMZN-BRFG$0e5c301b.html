<html><body><p> <strong>Amazon (AMZN -1%)</strong> delivered another Amazing result with its Q4 earnings report last night. It reported a huge beat-and-raise and strong performance in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment. Even so, the funny thing is the earnings results were not the headline of the report. The real big news was that Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in Q3. Andy Jassy will become CEO at that time. </p><p>Let's quickly examine the quarter first: </p><ul><li>Non-GAAP EPS was much better than expected ($14.09 vs consensus of $7.15) while revenue saw nice upside as well. </li><li> It is remarkable that a company as large as Amazon can post 43.6% yr/yr revenue growth to $125.56 bln. The pandemic and related online buying trends clearly helped fuel results for AMZN during the holidays. </li><li> Operating income rose 77% yr/yr to $6.87 bln vs $1.0-4.5 bln prior guidance. We were nervous about this metric because of the potential impact of AMZN's efforts to grow its fulfillment and logistics network square footage by 50%. Some of this expansion spilled into Q4. As these buildings ramp up, that creates short-term headwinds on the cost side. Plus, AMZN has been aggressively hiring more people. We knew that AMZN tends to be conservative with this guidance, but it's still reassuring to see the company report upside. </li><li>AWS had another terrific quarter. AWS segment sales rose 28% yr/yr to $12.74 bln, right in-line with +29% growth in Q3 and Q2. Most consumers interact with AMZN in terms of shopping, but its AWS service delivers more operating income than AMZN's North America and International shopping segments combined. </li><li>The Q1 guidance was solid, seeing revs of $100-106 bln vs. $95.5 bln consensus while expecting Q1 operating income of $3.0-6.5 bln vs $5.68 bln consensus. After a guide-down on operating income last time, we're happy to see in-line guidance. </li></ul><p><strong>Quickly on the CEO news.</strong> At first, we thought that the announcement might prompt the stock to sell off, but the market seems to be taking the news in stride. The thinking is that long-time insider Andy Jassy will pretty much continue what Bezos had been doing. Had they brought in an outsider, that would have caused some uncertainty. If anything, perhaps it's a boost for the AWS segment since Jassy has been CEO of AWS since its founding in 2003. Also, it's likely that Bezos as executive chair will remain active in Amazon's strategic decisions; he just won't be running the day-to-day operations. The transition reminds us of Bill Gates stepping down as CEO at <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> in 2000 but remaining as Chairman. </p><p>Overall, this was another great quarter for Amazon, and the CEO news seems to be getting interpreted by the market as a non-event.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
