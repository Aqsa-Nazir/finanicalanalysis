<html><body><p><strong>Intel's</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) soon-to-be spun off autonomous driving unit, <strong>Mobileye</strong> (<strong>MBLY</strong>), filed an amended IPO prospectus with the SEC, revealing key details about its upcoming offering. The main headline from the new filing is that MBLY is targeting a valuation of about $16 bln, far below expectations and down sharply from the $30 bln figure that INTC had pegged about a month earlier. Further illustrating just how far the IPO market has fallen this year, the projection for MBLY's valuation was at about $50 bln in late 2021. This downward spiral for MBLY has created yet another drag on INTC's stock, which has been pummeled by the severe deterioration in the PC/laptop market and the associated plunge in demand for chips.<br style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;"><br style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;">The prospects of INTC only doing a little better than breaking even on its $15 bln acquisition of MBLY is a very tough pill to swallow, but the ultra-conservative approach with the valuation makes sense. Given the ice-cold conditions in the IPO market, INTC and its investment bankers -- including <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> (<strong>GS</strong>) and<strong> Morgan Stanley</strong> (<strong>MS</strong>) -- want to set a price that will entice as many investors as possible, while limiting the risk of an immediate sell-off following the launch. That's easier said than done in these market conditions. However, the $18-$20 projected price range for the 41.0 mln shares offered should look appealing to many investors due to MBLY's solid growth, rapidly expanding addressable market, and profitability.</p><ul><li>For the six months ended July 2, 2022, MBLY's revenue increased by 21% to $854 mln as its ADAS platform gains traction with an increasing number of auto manufacturers. As of October 1, 2022, MBLY's products had been installed in about 800 vehicle models while its System-on-Chips had been deployed in over 125 mln vehicles.</li><li>Last year, MBLY announced over 40 design wins with major auto OEMs. That design win momentum has continued throughout 2022, leading MBLY to believe that its solutions will be embedded into more than an additional 270 mln vehicles by 2030.</li><li>With corporate growth rates under pressure due to rising interest rates, investors are placing much more emphasis on profits. That shift in priorities shouldn't be a detriment for MBLY's IPO since the business is already profitable on an adjusted basis. In the IPO prospectus, MBLY provided preliminary Q3 results, estimating revenue of $450 mln (+38%), adjusted gross margin of 73-74%, and adjusted operating income of $139-$143 mln (+11% at midpoint).</li><li>Based on MBLY's annualized revenue of roughly $1.75 bln for FY22, and its projected $16 bln valuation, the P/S pencils out to about 9.1x. Assuming revenue growth of 20% for FY23, MBLY's forward P/S drops to about 7.6x. Although we wouldn't characterize those valuation metrics as dirt cheap, they do seem quite reasonable in light of MBLY's growth potential.</li></ul><p>MBLY's IPO is a major event not only for INTC, but it will also have significant implications for the overall IPO market. By establishing that low price range, INTC's investment banking team is hoping that the stock performs well when it opens for trading on October 26. If that scenario unfolds, then other companies sitting on the sidelines waiting to go public will feel more confident about moving forward with their IPOs. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
