<html><body><p><strong>Adobe (ADBE +3%) </strong>is nicely higher today after starting out FY23 on a strong note. The company's Q1 (Feb) results included its largest EPS upside in seven quarters. Revenue and Q2 (May) guidance was in-line, same as last quarter. Adobe also raised its FY23 EPS guidance, which we think is being viewed very positively by investors. </p><ul><li> Its Digital Media segment performed well with revenue rising 9% yr/yr (+14% constant currency) to $3.40 bln. This was slightly above prior guidance of $3.350-3.375 bln. DM is by far Adobe's larger segment, so people watch it closely. Adobe's other major segment is Digital Experience, which allows businesses to manage/track customer experiences using analytics. DE saw revenue grow 11% yr/yr (+14% CC) to $1.18 bln, which was at the high end of $1.16-1.18 bln prior guidance. </li><li> Adobe addressed concerns about macro issues. Basically, there is really no change in its macro view since it set its annual guidance. Adobe says that digital is imperative for its customers. Also, a lot of the companies that have single product offerings are probably seeing more headwinds because clients may deprioritize some areas. Adobe has a broad, diversified offering which has helped. Adobe continues to see strong demand for its flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Acrobat and is excited about the traction it's getting with Adobe Express. Also, businesses continue to prioritize investments in digital. </li><li>Adobe also gave an update on its pending acquisition of Figma. Adobe has completed the discovery phase of the US DOJ second request and is prepared for the next steps, whether that is an approval or a challenge. Adobe believes the transaction remains on track to close by the end of 2023. We were surprised to get any color from Adobe, we were expecting a "no comment" on the DOJ angle, but Adobe sounds pretty confident. </li></ul><p> <strong>Overall, this was a very good quarter for Adobe.</strong> We had some trepidation going in following <strong>DocuSign's (DOCU)</strong> weak results last week, citing softening demand trends. But maybe that is a good example of what Adobe was talking about. Adobe is much more diversified than DocuSign and that is helping. Again, we think the main reason for move in the stock is Adobe raising FY23 EPS guidance by more than the Q1 upside, which surprised investors who have heard a lot from other tech names about longer sales cycles and deals getting harder to close with more layers of scrutiny. Adobe seems to be "Acrobating" right along.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
