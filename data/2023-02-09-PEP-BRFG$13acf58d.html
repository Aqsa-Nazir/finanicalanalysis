<html><body><p>Beverage and snack food giant <strong>PepsiCo (PEP +1%) </strong>has some pep in its step today after delivering upside on its top and bottom lines in Q4. The company also raised its annual dividend by 10% to $5.06 per share, marking its 51st consecutive dividend hike, and announced plans to repurchase approximately $1.0 bln of shares in FY23, displaying confidence by management in future cash flows.</p><p> However, not all items from Q4 popped. PEP expects FY23 earnings of $7.20, a 6.0% jump yr/yr, but below analyst estimates. It also projected a 6.0% expansion in organic revs for FY23, a slowdown from the 14.4% increase posted in FY22. Management explained that its slowing organic revenue growth prediction in FY23 stemmed from the expectation that elasticities will worsen in the back half of the year. </p><p>Still, the above deficiencies are not that substantial. Even with PEP building in some loss in its pricing power in 2H23, it still forecasts positive organic revenue growth for the year. The company is also controlling what it can, such as trimming expenses -- it reportedly reduced its headcount at its North American snacks and beverage division headquarters in December. </p><ul><li> PEP's Q4 results were also encouraging. The company grew its bottom line by 9.2% yr/yr to $1.67 per share on top-line growth of 10.9% to $28.0 bln. Despite lapping sound volume gains of 4% and 7% in its global convenient food and beverage businesses, respectively, PEP saw volumes fall just 2% in its foods division in Q4 while keeping beverage volumes steady yr/yr. <ul><li> Furthermore, PEP commented that it continued winning market share in many markets globally, a good sign that it is fending off private-label threats and that its price hikes are not spurring a material shift to alternatives from rivals <strong>Coca-Cola (KO) </strong>and <strong>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP)</strong>. </li></ul></li><li>Latin America continued to be an area of strength for PEP, with organic revs jumping 19% yr/yr on a 1% and 2% improvement in food and beverage volumes, respectively. Latin America has not seen volume declines in either business since 1Q21 as a post-COVID rebound continues to buoy consumer demand in the region.</li><li> On the other hand, Europe struggled in Q4, growing organic revs 12%, tying Asia Pacific for the lightest growth, on a 4% and 8% dip in food and beverage volumes, respectively. Volumes have not expanded in either category since 1Q21, spotlighting the extended challenges in the region. </li><li> Inflation also remained a high hurdle but is easing somewhat. Management stated that inflation is still elevated, but not as much as before, reflecting disinflationary forces we have heard mentioned by numerous organizations operating in the consumer staple sector, including <strong>Conagra (CAG)</strong> and <strong>Constellation Brands (STZ)</strong>.</li></ul><p> Overall, PEP's Q4 results were decent and contained many bright spots underscoring solid demand dynamics. However, its cautionary comments on elasticities worsening in the second half of FY23 are concerning. It will be interesting to see if KO and KDP see a similar scenario this year when they report Q4 earnings on February 14 and 23, respectively.  </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
