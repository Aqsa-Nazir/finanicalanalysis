<html><body><p><strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> is set to report Q3 results today after the close with a call to follow at 5pm ET. Current CapitalIQ consensus for non-GAAP EPS is $1.11 and for revenue it's $18.26 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter in the press release. In July, Intel guided to Q3 non-GAAP EPS of approx. $1.10 and revenue of approx. $18.20 bln. INTC also guided to Q3 non-GAAP operating margin of 30%. </p><ul><li><strong>Last quarter, Intel handily beat estimates but there were some trouble spots in terms of margins, guidance and a product delay.</strong> In terms of the headline numbers, Intel has reported five consecutive double digit beats.  </li><li>A problem area was non-GAAP gross margin, which fell to 54.8% from 61.6% a year ago. A drop was expected, but this result was slightly below internal expectations on higher product cost from faster uptake of 5G ASIC products which are margin dilutive. Margins were also hurt by an acceleration of 10-nanometer products overall. This will be an area to watch to see if this trend continues.</li><li>However, the development that really spooked the market most last quarter was Intel's announcement for a delay in its next-generation 7-nanometer technology by six months as the company found a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation. We'll definitely be looking for an update on this issue.</li><li> More generally, Intel has been cautious about 2H20. Following a very strong 1H20, Intel said it expects demand trends to moderate in 2H20. Also, after significant cloud expansion in 1H20 and into Q3, Intel expects capacity expansion to moderate as CSPs move to a digestion phase. Intel also cited an increasingly competitive environment in 2H20. We'll get our first taste of how these issues are manifesting in the 2H results. </li><li>Finally, Intel made some news this week as it announced a deal to sell its NAND memory and storage business for $9 bln to SK hynix. The transaction includes the NAND SSD business, the NAND component and wafer business, and the Dalian NAND memory manufacturing facility in China. We'll be looking for more color on this deal today.</li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
