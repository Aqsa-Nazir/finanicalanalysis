<html><body><p>The emerging trend towards eCommerce, which has accelerated during the pandemic, has provided a strong tailwind for FinTech companies like<strong> PayPal</strong> (<strong>PYPL</strong>). This potent catalyst was on display last night when PYPL reported impressive, upside 3Q20 results, highlighted by a 38% jump in total payment volume to $247 bln.<br><br>Notably, PYPL is generating robust growth even as <strong>eBay</strong> (<strong>EBAY</strong>) continues to roll-out its own payment platform. After spinning PYPL off in 2015, EBAY maintained PYPL as its primary payment processor until this year. Now, EBAY represents only 7% of PYPL's total volume.<br><br>The void from the dwindling EBAY business has been filled by a surge in new customers and an accompanying burst in transactions.<br><br>During the quarter, the company added over 15.2 mln Net New Active Accounts, for a total of 361 mln, and 1.5 mln new merchants, for a total of 28 mln. Not only is PYPL's user base rapidly expanding, but existing customers are also increasing their activity, as payment transactions per active account grew to 40.1 from 39.2 in the second quarter.<br><br>As a result, revenue grew by nearly 25% to $5.46 bln, representing its highest growth rate in over four years.<br><br>Despite the strong Q3 performance, shares are trading sharply lower. The weakness is a function of PYPL's lackluster guidance, cautious commentary from CEO Dan Schulman, and lofty expectations from investors.</p><ul><li>For Q4, PYPL is forecasting Non-GAAP EPS growth of 17-18%, which translates to EPS of about $1.01 vs. the $1.07 consensus estimate. Additionally, the company expects revenue growth of 20-25%, equating to revenue of approximately $5.95-$6.20 bln, in line with the $6.10 bln projection. <ul><li>In the Q2 earnings report, PYPL issued upside revenue guidance for Q3. Given the favorable trends underlying PYPL's business, many investors were likely anticipating a more bullish outlook for Q4.</li></ul></li><li>During the earnings conference call, Schulman stated that "economies around the world are still quite fragile" and that "this is the landscape we face as we go into the last quarter of 2020." <ul><li>The cautious tone of Schulman's comments suggests that he believes spending patterns could be pressured by macroeconomic headwinds in Q4.</li></ul></li></ul><p>From a company-specific perspective, there is plenty to be excited about. For instance, the Venmo app is rapidly gaining popularity, evidenced by the 61% spike in payment processing volume. Venmo's performance continues to exceed the company's expectations, and PYPL now expects Venmo revenue to approach $900 mln next year.<br><br>Furthermore, PYPL is moving into the physical retail space through its QR Codes solution. PYPL has ten major retailers signed up for QR Codes, including <strong>Nike </strong>(<strong>NKE</strong>), <strong>CVS</strong> (<strong>CVS</strong>), and <strong>Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond</strong> (<strong>BBBY</strong>), and it's in discussions with over 100 large retailers. PYPL's entrance into physical retail stores opens a massive opportunity in the offline market, but it could take several quarters before this business really moves the needle.<br><br>There is plenty to like regarding PYPL's Q3 results. The company's soft Q4 outlook, which seems entirely driven by macroeconomic concerns, is weighing on shares. However, PYPL's future still looks very bright as the explosion of eCommerce activity continues.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
