<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX +1%) </strong>is streaming modestly higher today after reporting Q2 results last night. It beat on EPS, missed on revenue and operating margin. It also guided Q3 EPS well below consensus. Revenue would have been in-line with guidance, adjusting for FX (US dollar strengthened more quickly than expected). Also, backing out restructuring costs, operating income was above guidance. NFLX's results are a bit messy every quarter. </p><ul><li> Management is great about providing a lot of details about its business, but not great in terms of laying out the financials and providing non-GAAP numbers. As a result, the main focus in the report was Q2 upside to global streaming paid net adds. The metric was still negative at -0.97 mln, but that was better than the -2.00 mln prior guidance. The new season of <em>Stranger Things</em> was a big hit and helped net adds in Q2. </li><li>NFLX also guided to Q3 at +1.00 mln. Street estimates for Q3 were a bit higher than that, so if you net Q2 and Q3, it was still better than expected overall but not the blowout numbers people were initially saying. However, it is good to see NFLX get back to growing net adds in Q3 after declines in Q1 and Q2. As more time passes since its price increase, that helps net adds as churn subsides. </li><li>We also got more color on its upcoming ad-supported tier. The plan is to launch this tier around the early part of 2023. NFLX will likely start in a handful of markets where ad spend is significant. To its credit, the plan is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. As such, its ad business will likely look different in a few years. The company believes advertising can fuel substantial incremental membership (through lower prices) and profit growth (through ad revenues). </li><li> The other big topic was how NFLX plans to tackle account sharing. The first model is pay a little bit more to add a member and share with those additional members. The second model is pay a little bit more to add an additional home and share the account with the additional homes. It is still in the early stages, but NFLX expects to roll it out in 2023. NFLX is currently testing strategies in some Latin America countries. </li></ul><p>We went into this report bracing for weak net add numbers for Q2 and Q3 guidance. We were a bit more pessimistic than the Street. But overall, Netflix performed pretty well in Q2 and the Q3 guidance was decent, especially considering it is lapping a tougher comp in Q3. However, when you net the two quarters, it was not the blowout people thought initially. We think that explains why the stock has pulled back after an initial +8% pop. </p><p>Netflix is going through a transition right now. It was early to the streaming game, dominated and defined it for years. However, its success has drawn others and now the competition is pretty intense. It is also working out an ad tier and figuring out how to combat account sharing. There are a lot of moving parts and the business model will look different in 2023.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
