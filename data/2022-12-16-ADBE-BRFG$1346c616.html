<html><body><p><strong>Adobe (ADBE +4%)</strong> is nicely higher today despite overall market weakness after ending FY22 on a strong note. The company's Q4 (Nov) results included its first double-digit EPS beat of the fiscal year and its biggest EPS upside in six quarters. Revenue and Q1 (Feb) guidance was in-line. Adobe also reaffirmed FY23 EPS and revs. </p><ul><li> Its <strong>Digital Media</strong> segment performed well with revenue rising 10% yr/yr (+14% constant currency) to $3.30 bln. This was slightly below prior guidance of +13% (+15% CC). We think the CC comparison is the truer comparison because it weeds out FX headwinds, which were greater than expected in Q4. It was also down a bit from +16% CC in Q3. However, we think it was a good number and was better than feared. DM is by far Adobe's larger segment, so people watch it closely. </li><li>Within the DM segment, Creative revenue grew to $2.68 bln (+13% CC) while Document Cloud revenue was $619 mln (+19% CC). The other metrics in DM were quite good as it had its best quarter ever for net new ARR at $576 mln, exiting the quarter with Digital Media ARR of $13.97 bln. Adobe says the strong results were driven by demand for its flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premier Pro and Acrobat. Adobe also expanded in both SMB and enterprise. </li><li>Adobe's other major segment is <strong>Digital Experience</strong>, which allows businesses to manage/track customer experiences using analytics. DE saw revenue grow 14% yr/yr (+16% CC) to $1.15 bln, which was better than +13% (+15% CC) prior guidance. DE subscription revenue came in at $1.01 bln, topping $1 bln for the first time ever. Adobe cited Chipotle as a good example of how the DM and DE segments work together. Chipotle uses Creative Cloud to design content for Web and mobile channels and Experience Cloud to highlight new product offerings and support a faster online ordering process. </li><li>Looking ahead to FY23, Adobe expects normal seasonality with Q1 being sequentially down and seasonally light for new business, then Adobe expects sequential growth in Q2, a dip in Q3 on summer seasonality, and a strong finish to the year in Q4. Quickly on the Figma acquisition announcement, which was announced last quarter. Adobe remains excited about Figma, which is used by millions of mobile and web developers. Adobe continues to expect to close the transaction in 2023. </li></ul><p>Overall, this was a good quarter for Adobe, following in <strong>Docusign's (DOCU) </strong>footsteps last week. The highlights were the big EPS upside, strong net new ARR growth in the DM segment and the revenue upside in the DE segment. While the overall results did not blow us away, we think they were much better than feared, especially the Q1 guidance. We had concerns macro headwinds might lead to a guide-down. It goes to show that businesses continues to prioritize investments in digital. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
