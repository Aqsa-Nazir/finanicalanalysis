<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX -3%)</strong> is streaming lower following its Q1 earnings report last night, but it has recovered after an initial 10% drop. The Q1 results were generally in-line, but the downside Q2 guidance caused the initial drop. However, the stock has recovered somewhat as investors started to understand the reasoning for the weak guidance, which we will get into later. Of note, NFLX said it expects to accelerate share repurchases over the course of 2023. </p><ul><li><strong>Global streaming paid net adds in Q1 were +1.75 mln. </strong>Unfortunately, NFLX no longer provides guidance on this metric, so we do not really know if it was better than internal expectations. NFLX wants investors to focus more on overall revenue and profitability and less on quarter-to-quarter net adds, which can be lumpy. Also, NFLX is developing new revenue streams where membership is just one component of its growth (like advertising and paid sharing). </li><li> A metric for which NFLX still does guide is operating margin. And that came in at 21.0% in Q1, ahead of the 19.9% prior guidance. Unfortunately, NFLX also guided to a sequential decline in Q2 at 19.0%. However, Netflix's operating margin can be lumpy given its production schedules and there a lot of changes going on. UCAN revenue grew 8% yr/yr while EMEA revenue was down 2% yr/yr. </li><li><strong>NFLX is rolling out two big changes to its model:</strong> an ad-supported tier and it is cracking down on password sharing (with the solution being called "paid sharing"). Probably the biggest news out of the report last night was Netflix announcing that it pushed back the broad launch of paid sharing (including the US) from late Q1 into Q2. </li><li> <strong>Paid sharing looks very much like a price increase. </strong>NFLX sees an initial cancel reaction, and then recovers as borrowers sign-up for their own Netflix accounts or existing members purchase an extra account. As a result, some of the membership growth and revenue benefit will fall in Q3 rather than Q2. Hence the weak Q2 guidance. Also, there will likely be some volatility in the net adds metric the next few quarters as paid sharing rolls out. </li><li>While the paid sharing launch got pushed back, NFLX rolled out its <strong>ad-supported tier</strong> in November 2022. <strong>So this was the first full quarter.</strong> It's still very early days, but NFLX is pleased with its progress. Engagement on its ad tier is above initial expectations and, as expected, NFLX has seen very little switching from its standard and premium plans. It's only a couple of quarters in, but the goal is to build a highly lucrative high-margin business. </li></ul><p>The stock is lower on the Q2 guidance. However, we think the recovery off its lows was because investors began to realize that the Q2 guidance shortfall was more related to the paid sharing roll out being pushed back. It was not really a demand shortfall. Looking ahead, investors should brace for a couple of volatile quarters in Q2 and Q3 especially for net adds as subscribers decide how to respond to NFLX cracking down on password sharing.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
