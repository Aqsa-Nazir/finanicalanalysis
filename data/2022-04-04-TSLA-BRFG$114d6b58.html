<html><body><p>Elon Musk is dominating the headlines today. Not only is the <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) CEO under the spotlight for establishing an ownership stake in <strong>Twitter</strong> (<strong>TWTR</strong>), but his electric vehicle (EV) company also reported Q1 production and delivery numbers that were better-than-feared. For the quarter, deliveries increased by 68% yr/yr to 310,048, slightly missing analysts' expectations. However, with supply chain concerns intensifying due to new COVID-related lockdown measures across China, the results provided a sigh of relief.<br><br>TSLA's report looks especially impressive when stacked up against <strong>Ford Motor</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) and&nbsp;<strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>), both of which are suspending production at plants in Michigan this week due to supply shortages. In March, Ford's U.S. sales plunged by nearly 26% yr/yr, while GM suffered a 20% yr/yr sales decline in 1Q22. It's been particularly disheartening to see Ford and GM continually push out their timelines regarding a normalization of the supply chain. After expecting significant improvements earlier this year, GM is now warning that disruptions will persist into 2H22.<br><br>In what Musk characterized as an "exceptionally difficult quarter", TSLA leaned on its ingenuity and resilient supply chain partners to deliver a relatively stronger performance. Still, TSLA is not immune to the challenges that are facing the entire auto manufacturing industry.</p><ul><li>In Q4, the company delivered more Model S/X vehicles (14,724) than it produced (14,218). This means that the delivery numbers were slightly inflated as the company completed orders from the prior quarter. Relatedly, total production was down on a sequential basis to 305,407 vehicles from 305,840 in 4Q21.</li><li>Next quarter could see a more significant decline if TSLA's Shanghai facility doesn't reopen soon. Due to government imposed lockdowns, that factory suspended production on March 28 and has continued to remain closed ever since.<ul><li>TSLA hoped that the shutdown would only last for four days, but China's "Zero COVID policy" is preventing authorities from easing restrictions. At this point, it's unclear when the Shanghai facility will be cleared to reopen.</li><li>The opening of TSLA's new Berlin factory on March 22 is timely and will ultimately expand its production by 500K vehicles annually. It takes time to significantly ramp up production, though, and automotive gross margin at the factory is likely to lag until economies of scale kick in down the road.</li></ul></li></ul><p>TSLA's production and delivery report highlights the divergence in performance between itself and key competitors like Ford and GM. The fact that production has remained relatively stable in the face of strict lockdown mandates is viewed as a green light for investors, especially in the wake of last week's stock-split news.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
