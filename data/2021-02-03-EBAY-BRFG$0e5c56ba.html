<html><body><p><strong>eBay (EBAY)</strong> is set to report Q4 results today after the close with a call to follow at 5pm ET. Last quarter, EBAY reported 16:05 ET, so investors should be on their toes. </p><ul><li> The CapitalIQ consensus calls for roughly flat yr/yr EPS (+2%) at $0.83, which is at the high end of prior guidance of $0.78-0.84. Revenue is expected to fall 4% yr/yr to $2.71 bln, current guidance is $2.64-2.71 bln. EBAY typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter. </li><li>eBay has been undergoing some major changes of late. A big change was made at the top when eBay's new CEO Jamie Iannone took the helm in April 2020. He has a strong ecommerce background; he was most recently COO of Walmart (WMT) eCommerce. </li><li> eBay has also been shedding businesses. In July 2020, the company announced it would sell its struggling Classifieds unit to Adevinta in a cash and stock deal worth $9.2 bln (deal is expected to close in 1Q21). In February 2020, eBay closed on its $4 bln sale of its StubHub ticketing businesses to Viagogo, a European rival. Also, in January 2021, eBay announced it's exploring strategic alternatives for its Korea business. </li><li>The purpose of these deals is to allow eBay to focus on its core Marketplaces segment, which has seen a boom in transactions since the pandemic started. So that will be the focus when eBay reports today. We'll also likely get an update on when the Classifieds sale will close, which should be in the coming weeks. </li><li>In terms of what to expect, eBay has a good track record in terms of beating consensus estimates. The company has not missed on EPS in the past five years, although the beats tend to be pretty small, in the low single digits, usually in the $0.02-0.06 range. Revenue upside tends to be modest as well. </li><li>Bottom line, besides just the headline numbers, we hope to get some good color on how eBay's transformation is going in light of the many changes. eBay will look a lot different in 2021 than it did in 2020 and we're interested to understand how the new eBay will be better positioned to compete. </li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
