<html><body>After posting phenomenal Q2 results on Tuesday night, <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) became a very tough act for <strong>Facebook</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>) to follow. Strong reports from fellow social media companies<strong> Twitter</strong> <strong>(TWTR</strong>) and <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) a week earlier added a degree of difficulty. With these upside results pushing expectations to sky-high levels ahead of FB's Q2 earnings report, the company's shares climbed to record highs. In order to prevent a let-down and to avoid a sell-the-news reaction, FB needed perfection last night.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While FB delivered impressive quarterly results that easily beat top and bottom-line estimates, the performance wasn't impeccable due to its cautious outlook. CFO Dave Wehner reiterated that yr/yr growth rates are expected to significantly decelerate in Q3 and Q4 as FB laps periods of increasingly strong growth. In isolation, the prospect for slower growth in 2H21 isn't surprising or troubling. In fact, GOOG CFO Ruth Porat also pointed out during the GOOG earnings call that the benefits of lapping favorable yr/yr comparisons will diminish moving forward.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">More problematic is the fact that the slowdown isn't simply related to lapping more unfavorable comparisons. Specifically, Wehner stated that rising ad targeting headwinds in 2021 will have a greater impact in Q3 relative to Q2.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This situation relates to changes that <strong>Apple </strong>(<strong>AAPL</strong>) made to user tracking and data collection capabilities within its iPhone operating system. Now, users must allow app developers to track their online activity, making it much more difficult for companies like FB to offer targeted ads. That's a major issue for FB because many of its advertising customers are smaller businesses that rely on more precise marketing campaigns.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For investors, an element of uncertainty is clouding the picture. Based on Wehner's commentary, it's clear that an increasing number of people are choosing not to be tracked on iOS. The question, though, is how severe the impact from the platform change will be. Also, it's unclear how long this headwind will persist.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In our view, we believe the strength in the online advertising market will mitigate much of the damage from the iOS change. The digital transformation that accelerated during the pandemic and that is reshaping virtually every kind of business, and the ever-increasing level of online activity from consumers, will continue to provide a powerful tailwind for FB.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Last night, COO Sheryl Sandberg stated that the same categories that performed well during the pandemic -- e-commerce, retail, consumer goods -- continued to drive much of the growth for FB. However, softer markets like travel, media, and entertainment are also experiencing a recovery.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As demand for online advertising gains strength, FB expects pricing to rise through the remainder of the year. In Q2, average price per ad soared by 47% yr/yr, providing a substantial portion of FB's total revenue growth. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The main takeaway is that FB was facing an unenviable scenario heading into its Q2 print in the wake of GOOG's blowout report. On an absolute basis, though, FB posted strong results, capitalizing on a very healthy online advertising market. Time will tell how significant an impact the iOS changes will have on FB, but we believe the company will effectively weather that storm as advertisers continue to flood online channels.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
