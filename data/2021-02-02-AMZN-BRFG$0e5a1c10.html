<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN) </strong>is set to report Q4 results today after the close with a call to follow at 5:30pm ET. Last quarter, AMZN reported 16:01 ET, so investors should be on their toes. The CapitalIQ consensus calls for a +9% yr/yr increase in non-GAAP EPS to $7.03 from $6.47 a year ago. Revenue is expected to grow 37% yr/yr to $119.73 bln, current guidance is $112-121 bln. AMZN typically guides for revenue and operating income for the next quarter. </p><ul><li><strong>Operating income is a metric that's closely watched. </strong>AMZN has previously guided to Q4 operating income of $1.0-4.5 bln, which was below consensus at the time, but AMZN tends to be conservative with this metric. Q4 operating income consensus is $4.59 bln while Q1 consensus is $5.68 bln. </li><li> This should be another interesting quarter for AMZN as many see the company as among the biggest winners from the pandemic with more people shopping online, especially during the holidays. The huge upside quarters from <strong>Fedex (FDX)</strong> in mid-December and <strong>UPS (UPS)</strong> today have surely raised expectations for AMZN today. </li><li><strong>Another key segment in this report will be AMZN's highly profitable Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> cloud computing offering. Most consumers interact with AMZN in terms of shopping but its AWS service, while not a huge part in terms of total revenue (13% of YTD revenue), AWS generated more operating income than AMZN's North America and International shopping segments combined. So, it's a big deal. </li><li><strong>AWS is a critical growth engine for Amazon and it's an important part of how investors evaluate Amazon overall.</strong> In Q3, AWS segment revenue rose 29% yr/yr to $11.60 bln (right in-line with +29% growth in Q2) with operating margin of 30.5% vs 25.1% in the year ago period. Last week, <strong>Microsoft's (MSFT)</strong> competing Azure saw revenue growth bump up to 50% yr/yr in DecQ, up from 48% growth in SepQ and 47% growth in JunQ. </li><li><strong>Last quarter, AMZN reported a huge EPS beat</strong> as the extra volume led to operating leverage and higher margins. A potential concern in Q4 is the fact that AMZN has been growing its fulfillment and logistics network square footage by 50%. The problem is that some of this expansion shifted out a few weeks and happened in Q4 rather than Q3. Once new buildings open, there are short-term headwind to profitability as they ramp up, so that may impact Q4. AMZN has also been aggressively hiring more people. We suspect there will be productivity losses as they get trained. </li><li>Finally, we'll also be looking for any update on the timing and scope of opening up more Amazon Fresh grocery stores.
