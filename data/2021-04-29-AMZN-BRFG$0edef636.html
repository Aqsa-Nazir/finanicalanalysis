<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> is set to report Q1 results today after the close with a call to follow at 5:30pm ET. Last quarter, AMZN reported 16:03 ET, so investors should be on their toes. The CapitalIQ consensus calls for a +92% yr/yr increase in non-GAAP EPS to $9.64 from $5.01 a year ago. Revenue is expected to grow 39% yr/yr to $104.63 bln, current guidance is $100-106 bln. AMZN typically guides for revenue and operating income for the next quarter. </p><ul><li><strong>Operating income is a metric that's closely watched. </strong>AMZN has previously guided to Q1 operating income of $3.0-6.5 bln, which was in-line with consensus at the time, but AMZN tends to be conservative with this metric. Q1 operating income consensus is $6.12 bln while Q2 consensus is $6.92 bln. </li><li> This should be another interesting quarter for AMZN as many see the company as among the biggest winners from the pandemic with more people shopping online. The huge upside quarters from <strong>Fedex (FDX)</strong> in mid-March and <strong>UPS (UPS)</strong> on Tuesday have surely raised expectations for AMZN's quarter today. </li><li><strong>Another key segment in this report will be AMZN's highly profitable Amazon Web Services (AWS) </strong>cloud computing offering. Most consumers interact with AMZN in terms of shopping but its AWS service, while not a huge part in terms of total revenue (12% of 2020 revenue), AWS generates more operating income than AMZN's North America and International shopping segments combined. So, it's a big deal. </li><li><strong>AWS is a critical growth engine for Amazon</strong> and it's an important part of how investors evaluate Amazon overall. In Q4, AWS segment revenue rose 28% yr/yr to $12.74 bln (right in-line with +29% growth in Q3) with operating margin of 28.0% vs 26.1% in the year ago period. Last night, <strong>Microsoft's (MSFT) </strong>competing Azure saw revenue growth remain robust at +50% yr/yr, equal to its +50% yr/yr result in DecQ, but up from 48% growth in SepQ and 47% growth in JunQ. </li><li><strong>Finally, the big news from last quarter was not just the huge beat-and-raise.</strong> The real big news was AMZN announcing that Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in Q3 and Andy Jassy will become CEO at that time. </li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
