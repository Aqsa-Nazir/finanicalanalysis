<html><body><p> <strong>Intel's (INTC -11%)</strong> shares are not looking too chipper today after the company <a bhref="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_ca7702ae49c039154861b9bb46736c56/intel/news/2020-10-22_Intel_Reports_Third_Quarter_2020_Financial_1424.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a> Q3 results/guidance last night. While the headline EPS and revenue numbers were in-line, there were a number of areas of concern within the report: </p><ul><li><strong>Probably the most surprising metric was Intel reporting a pandemic-driven 10% revenue decline for its Data Center Group (DCG)</strong>, which was most severely impacted by a huge 47% drop in its Enterprise &amp; Government subsegment. E&amp;G had previously reported two consecutive quarters of more than 30% growth, so this quarter's performance was a bit of a shock.  <ul><li>Another troubling aspect to the DCG weakness is that it extended beyond E&amp;G into Intel's Internet of Things Group (IOTG) and memory business (NSG) as well. </li></ul></li><li>The PC-centric segment (CCG) grew just 1% yr/yr on continued notebook strength even as more people work/learn at home. Given the rash of consumer purchases in home computing, a 1% increase seems pretty pedestrian to us. </li><li><strong>Non-GAAP operating margin dropped precipitously</strong> to 29.4% (vs guidance of 30%) from 35.9% a year ago due to lower data center ASPs driven by mix shift from E&amp;G to Cloud, and on the PC side, there was a much heavier mix of entry level PCs for both consumer and education markets. <ul><li> Probably the most troubling aspect to this is that Intel guided to even further margin compression in Q4 at 26.5%, which tells us that the problems are expected to linger. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Looking ahead, Intel cautioned that it sees many of the same dynamics in Q4</strong> that were in place in Q3. It expects continued demand weakness in IOTG and NSG as well as in the E&amp;G segment. However, Intel went a step further by saying that it expects demand from its Cloud segment, which has held up well, will moderate in Q4 with key customers entering a digestion period following multiple quarters of above trend-line growth. </li><li> In July, Intel spooked the market with a delay for its next-generation 7-nanometer technology by six months. We did not really receive a concrete plan in this quarter's updates to fix the company's manufacturing challenges. </li></ul><p><strong>What perhaps troubles us most are the ASP declines and margin compression both in Q3 and in the Q4 guidance.</strong> Intel argues that this is mostly a product mix issue rather than a symptom of competitive pressures. The company concedes that it is seeing increased competition in 2H20, though pretty much as expected. We are not totally convinced. We think it's likely that <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD</strong> in both data centers and notebooks) and <strong>Nvidia (NVDA</strong> in data centers) are making competitive inroads. </p><p>We would be cautious about buying Intel on a dip like we're seeing today. Intel seems to be undergoing some serious market/competitive conditions that will take time to work out, and Q4 is shaping up to be a difficult end to 2020. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
