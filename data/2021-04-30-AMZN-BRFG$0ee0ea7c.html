<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN +2%)</strong> had another Amazing result with its Q1 earnings report last night. It reported another huge beat-and-raise, and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment is booming. </p><ul><li> In terms of the headline numbers, non-GAAP EPS was much better than expected ($15.79 vs consensus of $9.55) while revenue saw nice upside as well. AMZN has now reported four massive earnings beats in a row. What we find remarkable is that a company as large as Amazon can post 43.8% yr/yr revenue growth to $108.52 bln. Operating income rose 122% yr/yr to $8.87 bln, well above the $3.0-6.5 bln prior guidance. </li><li>AWS had another terrific quarter. AWS segment sales rose 32% yr/yr to $13.50 bln. This compares to AWS segment revenue growth of +28% in Q4 and +29% in Q3. Growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. Amazon is seeing that, during COVID, many companies are deciding they no longer want to manage their own technology infrastructure. This trend should continue after the pandemic. </li><li> The acceleration in AWS was good to see after Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure had flat growth relative to its prior quarter. Azure's 50% growth was nothing to sneeze at, but it's impressive that AWS was able to show acceleration. </li><li>Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic. Any fear that vaccine rollouts and people getting out more will prompt a slowdown has thus far not been borne out. Looking ahead, AMZN announced a 2-day Prime Day set for Q2 (still waiting on specific dates), which should be a nice tailwind for Q2 results. </li><li>Advertising revenue within both the North America and International segments also accelerated nicely during the quarter. Higher traffic generally has been a large driver here, but internal improvements like deep learning models to share more relevant sponsored products are also contributing to growth. </li></ul><p> Looking ahead, remember that Andy Jassy will take over as CEO in Q3. We expect smooth sailing and little change because he's a long time insider. If anything, perhaps it's a boost for the AWS segment since Jassy has been CEO of AWS since its founding in 2003. The transition reminds us of Bill Gates stepping down as CEO at Microsoft in 2000 but remaining as Chairman. </p><p>Overall, this was another great quarter for Amazon. What jumps off the page is the acceleration in AWS growth, even as it works off a larger base. Finally, we wanted to mention that AMZN is trading at an all-time high today. The stock has been rangebound in the $3,000-3,500 area since last July. However, it's now starting to test the upper limits. If AMZN can achieve a sustained break above this range, it could signal a leg higher. That's a pattern we tend to like.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
