<html><body>In its quest to simplify its platform and focus on its core e-commerce business, <strong>eBay</strong> (<strong>EBAY</strong>) has executed a few transformational deals that are still reverberating throughout the company. Simultaneously, the reopening of the economy, increasing mobility, and reduced impact from stimulus programs are presenting headwinds. Adding to the challenge, EBAY faced unfavorable yr/yr comparisons in 2Q21 as it lapped the peak of the impact from the pandemic. All together, these factors led to EBAY reporting mixed Q2 results and offering Q3 guidance that signals a deceleration in top-line growth to 7-9%.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There are encouraging signs, too, that are pointing to stronger results in the quarters ahead. For example, the transition away from <strong>PayPal</strong> (<strong>PYPL</strong>) to EBAY's new payment platform is progressing well, with 71% of Q2 transactions having been completed through Managed Payments. According to CEO Jamie Iannone, that figure is on track to reach 90% in Q3, which should provide a nice boost to EBAY's transaction revenue. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Launching its own payments platform isn't the only substantial move that EBAY has recently implemented. EBAY also completed the divestiture of its Classifieds business to Adevinta for $13.3 bln, while subsequently selling ~135 mln shares of Adevinta stock for $2.4 bln to satisfy its commitment to Austrian regulators. Building on these streamlining efforts, the company sold over 80% of its Korean business to Emart for $3 bln in a deal that's expected to close by early 2022.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While EBAY sheds non-core assets, it is also taking aim at improving its e-commerce ecosystem. Its strategy includes focusing its marketing and product innovation efforts on "higher-valued buyers", described by Iannone as "buyers who sell, or buyers who purchase at least six days a year and spend over $800." Currently, these buyers represent ~20% of EBAY's buyer base but account for ~75% of total GMV. Encouragingly, not only did the high-value buyer base grow in Q2, but the amount these users spent increased at an even greater rate.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another aspect of the plan is to remove lower-value items from the site, improving the user experience while also pushing margins higher. At first glance, it may not seem like these tactics are having a positive impact, as gross merchandise volume (GMV) and active buyers declined by 11% yr/yr (FX-neutral) and 2% yr/yr, respectively.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However, the improvements come into better light when comparing EBAY's results against the pre-pandemic period of 2Q19. On that basis, EBAY states that it experienced positive underlying GMV growth as active buyers increased by 3%. Admittedly, EBAY's progress seems a bit pedestrian, but it will take some time for all these changes to be ironed out.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the midst of a major transformation, it's not overly surprising to see EBAY issue an underwhelming earnings report. There are many moving pieces to the story right now, making it more difficult to ascertain the true health of its business and to make accurate projections. For that reason, we believe the stock could face some headwinds until a cleaner picture emerges, even though some encouraging indicators are pointing toward stronger results down the road.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
