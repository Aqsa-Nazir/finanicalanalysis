<html><body><p>To borrow a phrase that Elon Musk used during last night's earnings conference call, <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) pulled a rabbit out of the hat in 1Q22 to post strong, upside results in the face of a production suspension, supply chain issues, and fierce inflationary pressures. A six-day shutdown of its Shanghai factory in late March acted as little more than a speed bump as deliveries surged by 68% yr/yr to 310,048. Demand was already red hot before fuel prices rocketed higher this year, but now interest in owning a Tesla is at a fever pitch.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Consequently, TSLA was able to raise prices in Q1, enabling it to mitigate the impact of a "multiple fold" jump in raw material costs. The company didn't disclose the increase in average selling prices (ASP), but it was probably significant, since automotive gross margin surged by 636 bps yr/yr to 32.9%. A positive mix shift toward the higher-priced Model Y also helped. Manufacturing efficiencies are the other main factor in TSLA's impressive margin performance. Its ability to maintain such a high level of execution in this turbulent environment is a testament to TSLA's workforce, which has become a major competitive advantage.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Whether that exceptional workforce can continue to defy the odds in Q2 and 2H22 was another primary concern heading into the print. With production in Shanghai just restarting this week on a limited basis, Q2 is off to a rough start. It could be several weeks before the plant is operating at full capacity. <br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Adding to the complexity is Musk's interest in acquiring<strong> Twitter</strong> (<strong>TWTR</strong>). Many worry that his attention will be divided during an incredibly challenging time for TSLA, which could result in a drop-off in performance. His presence on the earnings conference call was reassuring, especially since he offered some very encouraging commentary.</p><ul><li>After CFO Zach Kirkhorn stated that TSLA's delivery growth target of 50% or above remains attainable for this year, Musk one-upped him by commenting that a 60% yr/yr increase is possible. He conceded that Q2 production could be slightly lower than Q1 but added that Q3 and Q4 should be substantially higher.</li><li>Musk reiterated that volume production for Cybertruck is expected next year. That vehicle will be made at the newly opened facility in Austin, Texas, which is currently ramping production of the Model Y. While cautioning that it takes time for a new plant to reach high production volumes, he expects the Texas factory to churn out 5,000 vehicles per week in 9-12 months' time.</li><li>From a longer-term perspective, Musk highlighted the Optimus robot program, commenting that it will ultimately be larger than TSLA's electric vehicle business. The robot, which is currently slated to be launched next year, will allegedly be able to perform redundant human tasks, including those conducted in a factory setting.<ul><li>Given the state of chip shortages and vast supply chain issues, however, we are quite skeptical that TSLA will scale production of Optimus in a meaningful way over the coming twelve months.</li></ul></li></ul><p>One concern we do have is that automotive gross margin could slide a bit as the new Texas and Germany factories begin ramping production at higher volumes. Overall, though, it's hard not to be impressed by TSLA's execution and remarkable ability to overcome steep obstacles. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
