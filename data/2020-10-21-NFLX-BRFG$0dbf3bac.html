<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX -4%)</strong> is not wearing The Crown today. The streaming giant is trading lower today after reporting Q3 results last night. NFLX has a long history of reporting EPS upside relative to analyst expectations. However, the company has now tarnished that reputation a bit by delivering three EPS misses in a row in 2020. The good news is that NFLX reported revenue upside in Q3 and that its EPS guidance for Q4 was well ahead of consensus. </p><p><strong>The most important operating metric with NFLX is global streaming net adds.</strong> NFLX had prepared investors in July to brace for a weak net add number in Q3; the company said it saw a significant pull-forward of new sub adds in 1H20 due to the pandemic. In July, NFLX guided to Q3 net adds of just 2.50 mln, a big drop from 10.09 mln in Q2. We, and likely many other investors, felt that NFLX was being conservative. However, NFLX was spot on and actually came up a bit light with a final number at 2.20 mln. We also found the Q4 guidance of 6.00 mln a bit disappointing given that Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter. </p><p> In terms of other important metrics, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU got back on track at $13.40 in Q3 vs $13.08 a year ago and vs $13.25 in Q2. ARPU took a dip in Q2 due to a heavy dose of free trials; a return to growth for that metric now is encouraging. Operating margin was another bright spot at 20.4% vs 19.7% prior guidance. </p><p>On the content front, production work was halted earlier this year due to the pandemic. However, NFLX says it's making good and careful progress returning to production, particularly in EMEA and APAC, but also across much of LATAM and UCAN. NFLX has restarted production on some of its biggest titles, including season four of Stranger Things, action film Red Notice, and The Witcher season two. </p><p> Competition is a topic that seems to come up every quarter. In Q3, <strong>Comcast's (CMCSA)</strong> Peacock made its debut, coming on the heels of recent launches for HBO Max and Disney+. Plus, NFLX is facing the return of live sports programming and increasing competition from user generated content providers like YouTube and TikTok. NFLX seems unconcerned and says that it's thrilled to be competing with Disney and others. </p><p><strong>Bottom line, the EPS miss and particularly the net add miss are mostly responsible for the weakness in the stock today. </strong>A takeaway that we think investors will get from this report is that NFLX is not always trying to lowball guidance. When the company indicated that it expected a drop-off in net adds in Q3, the market felt that NFLX was just being cautious, but there was indeed a sizable drop-off. We think this report will reset expectations to some degree, so the next time NFLX says the net add sky is falling, we should believe the forecast.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
