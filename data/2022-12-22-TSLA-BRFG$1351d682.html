<html><body><p>It's been a whirlwind of a week for<strong> Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) as the EV maker continues to suffer the consequences from Elon Musk's controversial acquisition of Twitter while demand concerns also continue to swirl. On the latter point, the stock is taking another big hit today after <em>Reuters</em> broke a story that TSLA has doubled its discount on its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to $7,500. With today's losses, TSLA shares are now lower by nearly 15% for the week and are down by over 60% for the year.<br><br>Today's news is the strongest evidence yet that cracks are emerging in the demand story for TSLA.</p><ul><li>The company is notoriously stingy for offering discounts in the U.S., mostly because it hasn't needed to be promotional in the past. It is worth pointing out, though, that some would-be TSLA buyers have been holding off on making a purchase until 2023, when the new tax credits are expected to kick in. <ul><li>The exact requirements surrounding that tax credit were thrown into flux earlier this week when the U.S. Treasury Department said that it was postponing its decision on battery requirements. To entice buyers to make a purchase now, rather than waiting on a final resolution on the tax credit, TSLA made the aggressive move of doubling its discount.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In isolation, today's news may not be overly troubling and could be mainly explained away by the tax credit situation. However, when combined with a few other recent developments, the steep discount really solidifies the decelerating demand narrative.</p><ul><li>Following a <em>Bloomberg</em> report on December 5 that stated that TSLA was cutting its December Model Y production by 20% in Shanghai, <em>Reuters</em> followed up that story a few days later with news that TSLA will completely suspend production during the last week of 2022.</li><li>Rewinding a bit further, in October, TSLA cut prices on the Model 3 and Model Y in China by 5-10%.</li><li>During the Q3 earnings call, CFO Zachary Kirkhorn acknowledged that deliveries for FY22 may not meet its growth target of "50% average annual growth over a multi-year horizon." <ul><li>However, according to Kirkhorn, the shortfall is more related to transportation and logistics constraints, than demand.&nbsp;Recall that when TSLA reported Q3 production and delivery results on October 3, there was a large discrepancy between production (365K) and deliveries (343K). This difference was caused by challenges in loading huge batches of vehicles onto ships and trains during a timeframe of just a few days.</li></ul></li></ul><p>TSLA isn't immune to the dimming macroeconomic picture, but its issues run a bit deeper. Many argue that Musk's antics and rants on Twitter are tarnishing TSLA's brand and are turning off some buyers. There was some relief earlier this week when Musk said that he would abide by the results of his own Twitter poll  and step down from his CEO role of Twitter. That joy was short-lived though as shares of TSLA quickly resumed their free-fall. Sentiment hasn't been this negative on TSLA in a long time, which makes the stock pretty compelling to some investors, including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. For the stock to reverse course, though, the situation between Musk and Twitter must become more tenable for investors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
