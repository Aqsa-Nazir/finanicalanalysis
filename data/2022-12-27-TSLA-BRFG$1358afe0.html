<html><body><p>In desperate need of an emergency brake to stop this year-end free-fall, <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) is finding no relief today as concerns about softening demand kick into a higher gear. According to <em>Reuters</em>, the EV maker halted all production at its Shanghai plant on December 24, which follows a <em>Bloomberg</em>&nbsp;story from earlier this month that stated that TSLA cut its Model Y production by 20% at the same facility. <br><br>On both occasions, TSLA refuted the reports, but it seems pretty clear that the company is dialing back its activity in Shanghai as a combination of issues beset the company. In fact, an article from <em>Investor's Business Daily</em> essentially provided the "smoking gun" that business in China has weakened throughout December for TSLA. Specifically, IBD noted that Tesla registrations slipped to 8,915 from December 19-December 25, compared to 10,254 registrations the week before, and 12,977 registrations the week before that.</p><p>At the heart of the matter is the fear that TSLA's high-growth rate is in jeopardy of taking a major step backwards in FY23. As it currently stands, analysts are forecasting TSLA's revenue growth to slip to about 38% in FY23 from about 55% this year. Achieving a growth rate near 40% would still be a very impressive accomplishment for a company with a $360 bln market cap, but there's a growing sense that FY23 estimates will be ratcheted lower in the coming weeks. That belief stems from a few different factors.</p><ul><li>China just can't seem to break free from the grips of COVID-19. While the Chinese government has finally relented a bit on its crippling zero-COVID policy, now there are reports of virus breakouts across various parts of the country. This is causing worker shortages and is creating a ripple effect throughout supply chains, putting renewed pressure on production rates for manufacturers. <ul><li>Relatedly, TSLA competitor<strong> NIO, Inc. </strong>(<strong>NIO</strong>) significantly cut its Q4 delivery guidance today, stating that supply chain constraints have worsened in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.</li></ul></li><li>On the topic of competition, the EV market in China is becoming much more competitive. While TSLA once dominated the field there, competitors like <strong>NIO</strong>, <strong>Li Auto </strong>(<strong>LI</strong>), <strong>XPeng </strong>(<strong>XPEV</strong>), and <strong>BYD </strong>(<strong>BYDFF</strong>) are steadily gaining ground on the company.<ul><li>&nbsp;On that note, the aforementioned IBD article also reported that BYD's vehicle registrations actually increased for the week ending December 25, reaching 51,636 compared to 50,462 in the prior week.</li></ul></li><li>In the U.S., rising interest rates, high inflation, and possibly Elon Musk's antics on Twitter are weighing on demand. The severity of the problem came to light last week when <em>Reuters</em> reported that TSLA doubled its discount on its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to $7,500 in order to stoke sales.</li></ul><p>On January 2, a clear picture of the demand environment will be revealed when TSLA issues its Q4 delivery and production report. With the stock plunging by nearly 30% since December 15, it's safe to say that investors are anticipating a disappointing number. However, once that report is in the rearview mirror, it wouldn't be surprising if TSLA shares receive a bit of a jolt as buyers look to capitalize on the stock's plunge. Overall, though, the prospects for a more meaningfully rebound in the near-term look questionable as a preoccupied Musk has his hands full.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
