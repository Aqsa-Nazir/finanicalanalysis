<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX)</strong> is set to report Q2 results today on its website right at the close with a video call to follow at 6pm ET. Current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus is for EPS to grow 98% yr/yr to $3.15 and for revenue to grow 19% yr/yr to $7.32 bln. In April, NFLX guided to EPS of $3.16 and revenue of $7.30 bln. NFLX also guided to Q2 global streaming net adds of +1.00 mln. </p><ul><li> <strong>The most important operating metric with Netflix is global streaming net adds.</strong> NFLX has been all over the place in recent quarters. After missing prior guidance in Q3, NFLX rebounded with strong sub net add upside in Q4. However, Q1 came in at just +3.98 mln vs prior guidance of +6.00 mln and Q2 guidance at just +1.00 mln was pretty paltry. </li><li><strong>In Netflix's defense, the company is lapping massive net sub adds</strong> from last year when the pandemic was just getting underway. Not only are the year ago comps high, but there was also a pull-forward effect in 2020. At the same time, there was a near global shutdown in production. As a result, some key title launches initially set for 1H21 were pushed back into 2H21. NFLX insists the slowdown was not caused by competing streaming services. Competition has always been high. </li><li><strong>One more thought on the net sub adds.</strong> NFLX was lapping tough comps in Q1 and Q2 at 15.77 mln and 10.09 mln, respectively. The good news is that year-ago metric gets easier in Q3 at +2.20 mln, so hopefully the sub guidance is a bit more robust. </li><li><strong>In terms of other important metrics, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU keeps growing.</strong> It came in at $14.25 in Q1, up sharply from $13.51 in Q4 and $13.40 in Q3. NFLX rolled out a US price increase in Q4 and now we're seeing the effect roll into the ARPU metric. We will want to see another strong ARPU number in Q2. </li><li><strong>Operating margin has been another bright spot. </strong>It was at a record 27.4% in Q1 vs 25.0% prior guidance and vs 16.6% a year ago. NFLX also guided to Q2 operating margin of 25.5%. Net adds are what everyone focuses on, but we think this margin expansion merits recognition as well. This shows the benefit of the price increase and higher revs while at the same time production costs being reduced. </li><li><strong>Finally, we find the stock action a bit surprising.</strong> The stock has been basically trading sideways in the $475-575 area since July 2020, even as other tech names have been soaring. That makes us a bit cautious that a lot of the good news is priced in already. A final topic to listen for will be any color on expanding into video games. NFLX reportedly made a hire in the area recently, so it will be good to get some commentary. </li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
