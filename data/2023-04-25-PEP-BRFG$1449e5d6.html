<html><body><p><strong>PepsiCo (PEP +1%)</strong> topped earnings and sales estimates in Q1 while raising its FY23 guidance, reflecting a healthy end consumer as shoppers prioritize brand-name staples despite increasing price tags. Yesterday, <strong>Coca-Cola's (KO)</strong> upbeat Q1 numbers signaled that consumers will absorb higher-cost sodas and other beverages. However, investors mostly yawned at KO's solid report, perhaps due to the beverage giant only reiterating its FY23 financial targets despite its overall sturdy Q1 results. Therefore, by upping its FY23 adjusted EPS and organic sales growth outlook, PEP is popping to 52-week highs today. </p><ul><li> PEP grew its adjusted earnings 16.3% yr/yr to $1.50 on top-line growth of 10.2% to $17.85 bln, both topping consensus handily. When backing out FX, acquisitions, and divestitures impacts (organic basis), PEP grew its sales by 14.3%. Strength was broad-based on a reported and organic basis, with only Asia Pacific seeing declining sales growth. However, on that note, PEP stated that a growing optimism in China should act as a tailwind in its Asia Pacific market as the year progresses. </li><li>Resembling KO's numbers, PEP's pricing had a 16 pt positive impact on organic sales growth in the quarter, yet total organic volumes only slipped by 2%, adding further credence to the relative health of consumers. <ul><li>Breaking down volumes, in PEP's two largest divisions by revenue, Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) and PepsiCo Beverage North America (PBNA), growth was fairly steady from the year-ago period, with flat volumes in FLNA and a 2% dip in PBNA. Meanwhile, overseas, PEP's numbers mirrored KO's. For example, Latin America was a bright spot, with volumes climbing 1% and 5% in foods and beverages, respectively. However, Europe remained weak, as volumes tumbled by 5% and 11% in foods and drinks, respectively. </li></ul></li><li>Another similarity to KO was PEP expanding its non-GAAP operating margins. Although, PEP boasted a roughly 110 bp improvement yr/yr versus KO's 40 bps. CEO Ramon Laguarta commented that margins were assisted by an improved supply of materials and better labor availability. These favorable dynamics particularly helped Frito-Lay and should continue to buoy this business's margins in subsequent quarters, albeit possibly below Q1 levels, which Mr. Laguarta conceded were slightly elevated. </li><li> With demand remaining solid throughout Q1, PEP confidently increased its FY23 outlook, expecting adjusted EPS of $7.27 (up from $7.20) and organic sales growth of +8% yr/yr (up from +6%).</li></ul><p> The main takeaway is that within both the beverage category and convenience channel, PEP continues to enjoy robust demand despite continuously rising consumer prices, underpinning the relative strength of name-brand consumer staples. Although investors were not as warm toward KO as they are toward PEP, both companies' Q1 results are a good sign ahead of other consumer staples reporting earnings over the next few weeks.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
