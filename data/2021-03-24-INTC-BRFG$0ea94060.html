<html><body><p><strong>Intel's (INTC +1%)</strong> new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, is not wasting any time putting his stamp on the direction of the chip giant. He took over on February 15, replacing Bob Swan after a tumultuous two-year run. Mr. Gelsinger laid out several key initiatives at Intel's IDM 2.0 event yesterday, some of which were pretty surprising. </p><ul><li><strong>Probably the biggest news is that Intel will spend $20 bln to build two new factories</strong>, or "fabs", in Arizona. Intel is the only major US chip designer that still manufactures its chips domestically. Most chip companies are fabless, meaning they design the chips but farm out the manufacturing to third party foundries that are largely based in Asia. Most people had thought Intel would change course and become more of a fabless chip company. However, Intel is going the opposite direction and expanding production capacity for its own chips. It plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity in the US and Europe for other chipmakers and is establishing a new business unit, Intel Foundry Services, for that purpose. </li><li> <strong>This does not mean Intel is completely ignoring calls to rely more on outside manufacturing.</strong> In fact, Intel announced last night it will expand the use of third-party foundries for some products beginning in 2023. </li><li><strong>The company also offered an update on its 7nm product</strong>, which has suffered from manufacturing problems. Intel says its 7nm development is progressing well, supported by increased use of extreme ultraviolet lithography in a rearchitected, simplified process flow. Intel expects to tape in the compute tile for its first 7nm client CPU in Q2. This was encouraging to hear, but given the history, we are not getting too excited yet. </li><li><strong>And if all that were not enough, Intel also threw in some guidance.</strong> Intel was positive on Q1, saying it expects the final numbers to come in ahead of prior guidance, driven by continued strong notebook demand. However, full year guidance was more of a trouble spot, with non-GAAP EPS coming in below consensus. While Intel expects continued strong PC demand, PC revenue will be tempered by an industry-wide shortage of third-party components, such as substrates. The guidance may be conservative, but component shortages will be a headwind this year. </li></ul><p><strong>Clearly, that was a lot to digest from Intel.</strong> We have to admit that we were surprised that Intel is not going the fabless route, especially given the company's history of manufacturing issues with its 10nm and 7nm technology. Also, Gelsinger was previously CEO of <strong>VMWare (VMW)</strong>, a virtualization software giant. The whole purpose of virtualization is to farm out computing power to others. Semiconductors are clearly a different undertaken, but given his background, we thought he could direct Intel along the fabless route. Also, <strong>Apple's (AAPL)</strong> recent decision to switch from Intel processors to its own processors for its new series of Macs was not a ringing endorsement. However, we give Intel credit for making a bold move, and based on the stock reaction, investors seem pretty pleased. </p><p><strong>What does all this mean for other semi names?</strong> It's great news for semi equipment makers (such as <strong>AMAT +6%, LRCX +2%, </strong>and <strong>KLAC +4%</strong>, to name a few), who presumably will supply these facilities. Intel furthermore expects to accelerate capital investments beyond Arizona, with additional capacity expansion announcements in the US, Europe and other locations expected to come within the year. Given the industry's chip shortage and the increasing scrutiny of Chinese tech companies, Intel seems to be striking while the iron is hot with the capacity expansions and foundry services. All of this is not great for other third-party foundries (<strong>TSM -4%</strong>), while it's probably not a big deal but maybe a slight negative for Intel's closest competitor, <strong>AMD -2%</strong>.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
