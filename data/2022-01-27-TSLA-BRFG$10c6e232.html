<html><body><p>Staying true to recent form, <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) overcame supply chain constraints to exceed EPS and revenue expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter in its 4Q21 results. TSLA's ingenuity has enabled it to embed chips and other parts from new suppliers, while growing enthusiasm for electric vehicles (EVs) in general continues to provide a strong tailwind. The inflection point for the EV market that CEO Elon Musk described during TSLA's 2Q21 earnings conference call in July has clearly been reached. In addition to TSLA's impressive 4Q21 results, the EV market's breakout has been highlighted recently by the insatiable demand for <strong>Ford Motor's</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup and upstart <strong>Rivian's</strong> (<strong>RIVN</strong>) plans to sharply increase production to meet demand.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Bullish trends in the EV market tell only part of the story. After recording many years of unprofitability, TSLA is now a well-oiled machine with significant earnings power, thanks to steady improvements in manufacturing efficiency and economies of scale. These gains are best expressed in TSLA's automotive gross margin, which expanded by 648 bps yr/yr to 30.6%. It's unlikely that TSLA will maintain that level of margin improvement in FY22 as it opens new factories in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany. However, as TSLA is delaying its launches of Cybertruck, Semi, and a $25,000 car, those new factories may initially focus on producing Model 3s and Ys -- a process that the company has already mastered.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Pushing out the new EV launches didn't change TSLA's outlook of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. In fact, Musk expects FY22 delivery growth to exceed 50%. Despite the upbeat guidance, the stock is stuck in reverse today due to the following items:</p><ul><li>There's concern that the launch delays will cause TSLA to lose ground in a fiercely competitive market. Ford, <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>), and RIVN have all-electric pickup trucks on the market this year, creating fear that TSLA's Cybertruck will fall behind.<ul><li>Musk believes that launching new vehicles when the company is already parts-constrained doesn't make sense. That's a sensible view, but the constant moving of the goal posts is a source of frustration.</li></ul></li><li>Relatedly, Musk's grandiose plan for TSLA to have fully self-driving cars by the end of 2022 isn't resonating well with investors. Considering the substantial issues that TSLA's autopilot technology has encountered --  including its role in a dozen crashes that spurred an investigation by the NHTSA -- launching a truly self-driving EV this year seems like a stretch.</li><li>The bottom line from the two points above is that the growth story for FY22 lost some luster in the eyes of investors. With a P/S in the 25x neighborhood, the stock has little wiggle room if growth expectations change.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that TSLA continues to operate at a high level in a very challenging environment as EV demand remains red-hot, but its plans to delay new vehicle launches remove a key FY22 growth catalyst.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
