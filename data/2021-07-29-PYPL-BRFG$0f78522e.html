<html><body><p><strong>PayPal (PYPL -5%)</strong> could use a pal today: investors are selling off the stock after the company guided Q3 and FY21 earnings below consensus. PYPL's downside FY21 earnings guidance is primarily due to <strong>eBay (EBAY)</strong>, the company that spun off PYPL in 2015, transitioning to its managed payments system. This system allows buyers to transact without a PayPal account, with funds going directly into sellers' bank accounts instead of to their PayPal accounts.</p><p>  Investors may also be disappointed with PYPL's forecasts regarding the total payment volume (TPV) impact from eBay. PYPL stated during its Q1 earnings call in May that eBay's managed payments transition had accelerated. PYPL expected payment volume from eBay to be about 3% of its TPV by the end of 2021. However, PYPL's expectations were slightly off, and it now expects eBay payment volume to be 2.5% of PYPL's TPV by year's end. </p><p> <strong>Despite eBay opening up payment options on its site, we think there are still plenty of reasons to like PYPL's story in the long run. </strong></p><ul><li>PYPL still grew revenue by 19% to $6.4 bln, even though eBay revenues on PYPL's platform declined 51% yr/yr in Q2. Furthermore, eBay's drag on PYPL this year will be essentially gone by Q4, which positions PYPL for accelerated revenue growth in 2022. PYPL even stated during its Q2 earnings call that the sooner eBay transitions, the better it is for its future revenue growth. </li><li> Also, the expiration of PYPL's operating agreement with eBay allowed PYPL to launch an extensive partnership with <strong>Alibaba (BABA)</strong>. Although BABA will not force users to use PayPal as eBay did, the deal is still notable given BABA's enormous footprint. BABA's gross merchandise volume (GMV) for its March quarter was $1.2 tln, while eBay's GMV was $27.5 bln. In our view, this partnership with BABA sets PYPL up for long-term growth. </li><li> PYPL also added 11.4 mln net new active accounts in Q2, bringing its total merchant count to 32 mln. This shows that PYPL is still adding millions of new users to its platform even without eBay forcing its customers to open up a PayPal account. </li><li> PYPL also owns Venmo, a more social-oriented payment system through which users link their social media profiles to the app. Venmo saw astounding growth in Q2 with 58% yr/yr TPV growth and over 300K business profiles created. Although only available in the US, there are currently over 76 mln active accounts on Venmo. For younger generations turning to digital payments, Venmo is a welcome choice as it incorporates a social component into money transfers. </li><li> Finally, looking ahead, PYPL still expects to grow its total merchant accounts to the higher end of its 52-55 mln range by year-end. PYPL also reaffirmed its FY21 earnings and revenue guidance of $4.70 and $25.75 bln, respectively. </li></ul><p> Bottom line, PYPL underestimated how quickly eBay would transition to its managed payments system, leading to downside Q3 and FY21 earnings guidance. We think that eBay's impact on PYPL for 2021 is a short-term hiccup, especially given PYPL's revenue and new user growth in Q2. Furthermore, today's sell-off could be an overreaction to how important PYPL's exclusivity with eBay is in driving long-term growth. After eBay fully transitions, the digital acceleration following COVID should provide a sustained tailwind for PYPL in the long run.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
