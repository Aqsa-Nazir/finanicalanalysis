<html><body><p><strong>Tesla's</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) recent price cuts in both the U.S. and China, combined with the new U.S. tax credits for electric vehicles, helped to offset the macroeconomic headwinds in Q1 as deliveries jumped by 36% yr/yr to 422,875 vehicles. That figure, which represents a new quarterly record for TSLA, slightly topped analysts' expectations and helped ease concerns that rising competition -- particularly in China -- was putting a dent into demand.</p><ul><li>Model 3 and Model Y were especially strong with combined deliveries of 412,180, up 40% yr/yr. Recall that in mid-January, TSLA slashed U.S. prices by as much as 20% on those models in order to qualify those vehicles for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. </li><li>In contrast, deliveries of the pricier Model S and Model X declined by about 27% yr/yr to 10,695 as TSLA implemented much smaller price reductions of 5-9% on those vehicles. Additionally, those price cuts didn't take effect until early March.</li></ul><p>Once again, there was a sizable discrepancy between production (444,000) and deliveries (422,000) in Q1.</p><ul><li>When this issue first materialized a few quarters ago, it added to the mounting concerns that demand was softening, causing inventories to build up. However, now that it's clear that demand is still healthy, thanks in part to those price cuts, investors have grown more comfortable with TSLA's explanation for the gap between production and deliveries. </li><li>Specifically, the difference is related&nbsp;to TSLA's transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds to contend with the increasing difficulty of securing vehicle transportation at a reasonable cost.</li></ul><p>Despite the easing concerns about demand and TSLA's solid Q1 production and delivery report, shares are still selling off today.</p><ul><li>The weakness is at least partially driven by a sell-the-news reaction after the stock jumped by over 6% last Friday. In fact, on a year-to-date basis, shares have soared by nearly 70%, paving the way for investors to lock in some profits.</li><li>Worries about falling ASPs and automotive gross margin could also be playing a roll in the pull-back. TSLA is scheduled to report 1Q23 earnings on April 19 and market participants will be keeping a close eye on how its price cuts impacted margins and profitability. </li><li>Last quarter,&nbsp;automotive gross margin dove by 466 bps qtr/qtr to 25.9% as the company continued to ramp up production at its new Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany plants. For Q1, gross margin is expected to plunge to about the 20% level.</li></ul><p>Overall, though, TSLA's strategy to sacrifice margins in order to spark demand and protect market share is playing out quite well for the company. In the long run, marking its vehicles more affordable and expanding its target market will be key to achieving its ultimate goal of 20 mln in annual deliveries.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
