<html><body>Staying true to form, <strong>eBay</strong> (<strong>EBAY</strong>) edged past analysts' EPS and revenue expectations in 3Q21, continuing its multi-year streak of meeting or slightly beating earnings forecasts. This time around, however, modest upside performance wasn't enough to appease investors, many of whom are sitting on sizable gains with the stock within shouting distance of record highs.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The sell-the-news reaction isn't solely due to profit-taking, though, as concerns about EBAY's sliding growth rates escalate. With gross merchandise volume (GMV) declining by 10% to $19.5 bln in the quarter, it's evident that the pandemic-related tailwinds have diminished as consumers spend more on travel, entertainment, and shopping at brick-and-mortar stores.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">CEO Jamie Iannone downplayed the GMV drop during the earnings conference call and stated that the performance was in line with internal expectations. In addition to lapping a difficult yr/yr comparison (GMV was up 22% in 3Q20), there is a fundamental reason why Iannone isn't overly worried about the decline. As part of EBAY's transformation, the company is focusing on "high-value buyers", who are described as buyers who purchase at least six days a year and spend over $800.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Simultaneously, EBAY is weeding out low-value product categories in order to funnel activity toward higher-end products like watches, shoes, and handbags. At the end of Q2, about 10% of EBAY's global GMV had transitioned to this new model. By the end of the year, EBAY expects to expand that figure to around 20%.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">In the long run, EBAY hopes to create a more profitable platform that is more functional, streamlined, and efficient. Another part of this strategy includes the divestiture of non-core assets, such as its the Classified business, which was recently sold to Adevinta for $13 bln. To achieve its final goal, though, EBAY will need to sacrifice some GMV growth as it sheds products and buyers. On a related note, annual active buyers slipped by 5%, but high-value buyers were up by 6%.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">As EBAY strives to improve its product and buyer base, it's also adding new advertising tools to help sellers market the higher-value merchandise. Uptake has been strong, with Promoted Listings delivering $207 mln in revenue, up 12% yr/yr, to outpace volume growth. More advertising products are on the way, too; Promoted Listings Advanced and Promoted Listings Express are currently in beta testing. <br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Progress is being made in EBAY's transformation, but the focal point today is on the mediocre Q3 results and soft Q4 guidance. For next quarter, the company is forecasting EPS of $0.97-1.01 vs. the $1.00 consensus estimate and revenue of $2.57-2.62 bln vs. the $2.65 bln expectation. Considering that investors were hoping for a strong holiday season push, the downside revenue guidance is especially discouraging. The outlook could prove to be conservative as shoppers turn to EBAY's platform to find products that are unavailable elsewhere, but investors aren't giving the company the benefit of the doubt today.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
