<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX) </strong>may be trying to game the system - in a good way. According to Bloomberg, Netflix is planning an expansion into video games and has hired Mike Verdu, a former Electronic Arts (EA) and Facebook (FB) executive, to lead the effort. Its goal is to offer video games on Netflix's streaming platform within the next year. </p><p><strong>Some quick thoughts:</strong> </p><ul><li>The news is not entirely surprising, given that Netflix has fielded questions about moving into gaming during several earnings calls, and management has seemed receptive. What is new information is that a seasoned executive has been hired, which suggests that the idea is moving from possibility stage into "let's do this" stage. </li><li>We think it would be a smart move. Gaming is a natural adjacency for streaming TV. As Netflix mentioned on its last call, it has made a few forays into gaming-adjacent offerings already, including through interactive programs for kids or the interactive film "Bandersnatch" from its anthology series Black Mirror. Also, gaming should allow Netflix to raise prices further or maybe to a carve out an increase just for gaming. </li><li>Expanding into gaming would also differentiate Netflix from its competitors. It already has a big subscriber lead over other streaming plays, but some are closing the gap, especially Disney+. Moving into gaming should draw new customers and open up a whole new market. If successful, rivals would likely follow suit; however, it would be great for Netflix to build a big lead and get that first mover advantage. </li><li>One criticism of Netflix is that its US business is not growing as strongly as it used to now that the company is so large that it may be reaching saturation levels. Q1 global streaming net adds came in at just +3.98 mln vs prior guidance of +6.00 mln, and Q2 guidance at just +1.00 mln was pretty paltry. Granted, NFLX is lapping the pandemic, but it's nevertheless a lingering concern. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, we like the idea of NFLX expanding into gaming. </strong>It should open up new growth opportunities in terms of subscribers. However, we also have concerns. When Netflix launched streaming TV, it lacked competitors. In fact, many people doubted the model could work.  Gaming is different. PlayStation and Xbox are dominant players in this space, and they already offer monthly subscriptions for games (PlayStation Plus, Xbox GamePass). Also, their consoles have robust graphic chips, and there is already a plethora of gaming accessories made for those platforms. We do not have a lot of details on how Netflix's platform would work or whether it would partner with existing console makers. Hopefully we get some color when NFLX reports Q2 results next week.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
