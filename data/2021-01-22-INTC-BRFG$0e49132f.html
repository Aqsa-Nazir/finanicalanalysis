<html><body>The first earnings report for incoming <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) CEO Pat Gelsinger was certainly a memorable one as the semiconductor company's 4Q20 results were leaked early, crossing the wires about fifteen minutes before the closing bell. The leak, which INTC believes may have been the result of a hack, produced a late day push higher in the stock as investors reacted to the better-than-expected performance and upside 1Q21 guidance.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While the stock is weak this morning, keep in mind that shares were up 6.5% yesterday, including a 2.5% last minute surge due to the early release.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The surprise release of INTC's report wasn't the only peculiar development. Recall that on January 13, the company provided an updated outlook for Q4, stating that it expects EPS "greater than $1.10" and revenue of "more than $17.4 bln". It turns out that INTC blew out this original guidance from last quarter, rendering these numbers an inconsequential measuring stick. One week ahead of the report, it seems that INTC could have provided a much more fine-tuned look into the Q4 numbers. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Oddities aside, INTC's results showed improvement overall, but the company isn't firing on all cylinders. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The standout performer was the PC-centric business, which generated revenue growth of 9%, up sharply from last quarter's 1% increase. This segment has benefited from the spike in demand for PCs and laptops in support of remote working and learn-from-home transitions. During the quarter, CPU units for INTC surged by 33%, indicating market share gains.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Following a disappointing quarter for the Data Center Group (DCG), investors were eager to see a rebound in this highly competitive business. That recovery didn't materialize in Q4, however, as DCG revenue fell by 16% to $6.1 bln, reflecting a downturn from the 7% dip in Q3. Although INTC didn't peg a growth rate to the enterprise and government market, it cited continued weakness in these verticals. Last quarter, revenue from enterprise and government customers plunged by 47%, with INTC attributing the softness to economic uncertainties related to COVID-19.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fueled by a 39% jump in Mobileye revenue, the Internet of Things Group (IOTG) did experience a significant improvement from last quarter's 33% dive. Mobileye, which develops autonomous driving and driver-assistance technology, achieved record quarterly revenue of $333 mln, offsetting weakness in industrial IoT markets. In total, revenue for the IOTG segment declined by 16%.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Beyond the quarterly performance, many market participants tuned into INTC's earnings call to see if the company would provide specific manufacturing plans. Last July, the company disclosed that manufacturing issues would delay the launch of new 7-nanometer technology, provoking calls from investors to consider using third party producers.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One of Gelsinger's first priorities will center on correcting INTC's manufacturing mishaps. During the earnings call last night, he was vague about his plans, commenting that a majority of 2023 products will likely be manufactured internally, but the company will also likely expand its use of external foundries for certain products. Gelsinger also refrained from providing FY21 guidance because he needs more time to fully assess his analysis before deciding on the best path forward.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This ambiguity may be a factor behind today's weakness, but we believe the pullback is also related to some profit-taking following the stock's ~20% rally to start the year. That's a sizable and rapid run higher for a company that faces major challenges as it looks to improve its competitive standing. What last night's report showed was that INTC still has a dominant position in PCs, but it has its work cut out for it in the higher-growth data center and cloud computing markets.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
