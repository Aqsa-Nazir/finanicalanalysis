<html><body><p><strong>Intel (INTC -17%)</strong> is not feeling too chipper following yesterday's earnings <a bhref="https://www.intc.com/investor-relations/investor-education-and-news/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Intel-Reports-Second-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/" target="_blank">report</a>: the semiconductor giant handily beat estimates, but it revealed some trouble spots in terms of margins, guidance, and a product delay. Expectations were running high heading into this report as several companies in the industry have recently reported strong results (like TXN on Tuesday and MU in late June) while several others have increased their guidance.  </p><p><strong>In terms of the headline numbers, Intel did not disappoint.</strong> It reported a $0.12 EPS beat, its fifth consecutive double-digit beat. Revenue had nice upside as well. Data-centric (DCG) segment revenue was the star of the show, up 34% yr/yr to $10.2 bln, representing 52% of total revenue, an all-time high. DCG segment revenue was driven by huge growth within data centers, up 43% yr/yr to $7.1 bln. In the PC-centric segment, revenue growth tends to be more modest, and that played out again in Q2, up 7% yr/yr to $9.5 bln on strong notebook PC sales. </p><p><strong>Now we turn to the more challenged areas.</strong> Non-GAAP gross margin fell to 54.8% from 61.6% a year ago. A drop was expected, but this result was slightly below internal expectations on higher product cost from faster uptake of 5G ASIC products, which are margin dilutive. Margins were also hurt by an acceleration of 10-nanometer products overall. </p><p><strong>The development that we think is spooking the market most today was Intel's announcement for a six-month delay in its next-generation 7-nanometer technology</strong>, as the company found a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation. Intel says that it has root-caused the issue and believes that there are no fundamental roadblocks. However, a delay is a real concern. Plus, investors are likely having flashbacks to Intel's delays with its 10-nm platform. Consecutive platform rollout delays are disappointing. </p><p><strong>Another misstep was the guidance. </strong>Intel guided below consensus for Q3 EPS, although it projected revenue upside. And while it was good to see Intel re-instate full year guidance with modest upside, the company was a bit more somber on the call. Intel said that, following a very strong 1H20, it expects demand trends to moderate in 2H20. Also, after significant cloud expansion in 1H20 and into Q3, Intel expects capacity expansion to moderate as CSPs move to a digestion phase. Intel also cited expectations for an increasingly competitive environment in 2H20. </p><p>Overall, Intel followed the trend of other chipmakers reporting/guiding to robust Q2 results. However, that the guidance was cautious, and, most importantly, that delay of the 7-nm rollout must have investors rolling their eyes again after the 10-nm problems. We view the delay as the main reason why the stock is down so much today. It's also weighing down semi equipment names: <strong>KLAC -6%, AMAT -5%, LRCX -4%.</strong></p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
