<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX +6%)</strong> shares are binging on gains today, breaking above previous resistance around the $335 mark, following the streaming giant's Q4 earnings report, which contained several positive standouts and exceeded relatively high expectations. NFLX also announced that CEO Reed Hastings will step down and become Executive Chairman, completing the company's succession plan, with COO Greg Peters stepping up to become co-CEO with Ted Sarandos (previously was co-CEO with Mr. Hastings). </p><ul><li> <strong>The highlights in Q4 were plentiful</strong>. NFLX crushed its paid net adds forecast in the quarter, boasting +7.66 mln compared to its outlook of just +4.50 mln. Additionally, net adds are projected to see modest positive growth in 1Q23 from the -0.2 mln in the year-ago period, a significant plus as it signals NFLX's return to yr/yr net adds growth since 3Q21. <ul><li> NFLX attributed substantial acquisition and retention as the two leading factors for its massive net adds in Q4, primarily fueled by its content slate. </li></ul></li><li>Meanwhile, although not an expansion, operating margins of 7%, a 1 pt dip yr/yr, toppled NFLX's expectation of just 4%. The company also anticipates a return to margin expansion in FY23, guiding to roughly 21-22% margins, up from its prior target of 19-20%.<ul><li> Also, free cash flow is expected to nearly double yr/yr in FY23 to at least $3.0 bln.</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Paid sharing</strong>, NFLX's solution to the password sharing issue, is expected to roll out more broadly later in 1Q23, likely resulting in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern during the year. NFLX expects net adds in 2Q23 to likely surpass numbers in 1Q23 since initial tests have shown immediate cancel reaction affecting near-term member growth. </li><li> <strong>Regarding its ad-supported tier</strong>, which has been active in 12 countries since November, NFLX remarked that there is plenty to do to improve targeting and measurement but is pleased with its progress thus far. Reactions have confirmed NFLX's view that its ad-supported plan will generate incremental revenue and profit. Still, the company conceded that the impact on FY23 will be modest. </li><li><strong>Long-term objectives remained unchanged</strong>. NFLX continues to set its sights on double-digit revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and positive free cash flow. </li></ul><p>Overall, even after a string of solid earnings results raised the bar for NFLX heading into its Q4 report, it smashed expectations on many fronts. The company's numerous bright spots also engulfed the few minor blemishes in the quarter, including an earnings miss, muted sales growth of just 1.9% yr/yr to $7.85 bln, and an underwhelming Q1 earnings forecast, all of which were driven by a strong U.S. dollar. </p><p> Bottom line, NFLX's many developments, including a projected return to positive net adds growth, an ad-supported plan, paid sharing, and video game offerings, are keeping the enthusiasm surrounding the stock elevated. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
