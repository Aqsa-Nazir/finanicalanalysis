<html><body><p><strong>Adobe's (ADBE -1%)</strong> release of Q1 results largely matched our expectations: another big beat-and-raise from the company, and yet the market yawns. Adobe has now posted four consecutive double-digit EPS beats since the pandemic began, making it clear that Adobe is benefiting from the pandemic, which has caused more companies and consumers to shift to digital document creation. </p><p>The pandemic accelerated the need for digital transformation among businesses of all sizes. For example, Adobe says that small and mid-sized businesses had to quickly set up digital storefronts while enterprise customers that had not yet made substantial digital investments took the leap. Entire industries from media and entertainment to pharma, retail, automotive, and financial services had to pivot nearly overnight to digital operations. This dynamic once again factored into Adobe's results. </p><ul><li>Adobe reported strong upside relative to analysts' expectations for both EPS and revenue. Momentum is forecast to carry into the balance of FY21: Adobe guided well above consensus for both Q2 (May) and FY21. </li><li> Coming into this report, we had concerns about the guidance because Adobe is now starting to lap the onset of the pandemic. However, the robust guidance put our fears to bed, giving credence to Adobe's claims that this digitization trend is not going to fade away as the pandemic passes. </li><li>Digital Media, Adobe's largest segment, which includes Adobe Document Cloud, saw revenue jump 32% yr/yr to $2.86 bln, a nice acceleration from Q4's +20% growth to $2.50 bln and well above prior guidance of +26%. However, the Q2 guidance for this segment points to a modest deceleration next quarter to +21%. </li><li> Beyond the document creation space, Adobe is also seeing greater demand on the Creative Cloud side, which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Lightroom, and InDesign. Adobe cites a student uploading his video homework or a small business owner designing her first website as examples of customers who have engaged with Creative Cloud offerings in the past year. Creative Cloud remains a market leader in several creative categories (imaging, design, video, screen design, and illustration), but Adobe is also expanding into emerging media like 3D and AR. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, Adobe has to be right up there</strong> in terms of the top software names tailor-made for the pandemic. <strong>(DocuSign (DOCU))</strong>&nbsp;is another that comes to mind.) As people work from remote locations, digital document creation and creative media production become more essential than ever. We had concerns with Adobe starting to lap last year's pandemic-fueled sales, but the robust guidance shows that Adobe is confident that the digitization trend will endure. Finally, the lack of excitement in the stock price is disappointing; it tells us that a lot of good news is priced in already. We'd be careful about chasing the stock up here.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
