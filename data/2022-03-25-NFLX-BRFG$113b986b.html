<html><body><p>With the release of additional <strong>Netflix (NFLX -1%)</strong> mobile games earlier this week and the company's acquisition of another game development studio yesterday after the bell, we wanted to touch on NFLX's entrance into video gaming, particularly given the stock's recent crash. Following the company's announcement of underwhelming Q4 guidance in late January, when NFLX missed global paid net adds expectations and guided Q1 revenues below consensus, shares plummeted; they now trade close to April 2020 levels. </p><p> NFLX first discussed mobile video games during its Q3 earnings call in October, but nothing launched until about a month afterward. Therefore, NFLX's Q4 earnings call was where it delved into the topic of mobile gaming more extensively. The company noted that daily active users had been growing monthly up to that point. However, NFLX was more excited to discuss its own game studio. At the time, it was hiring talent and acquiring studios, which we suspect is still in its early stages. </p><p> As an excellent intellectual property portfolio is in NFLX's grasp, its gaming division, which currently offers only mobile games free for paying Netflix users, could work as a sound asset to retain and woo new subscribers.</p><ul><li>As NFLX has raised its subscription fee by about 11% in all of its markets outside India, current subscribers may be contemplating canceling their memberships, especially amid a boom in competing services. For example, just a few weeks after NFLX posted net adds of just +8.28 mln for Q4, less than double those of Q3, <strong>Disney (DIS)</strong> reported that it added +11.8 mln new Disney+ subscribers in Q4, nearly five times more than in the previous quarter. While Disney+ subscribers are not offered additional services, that service's monthly fee is about 20% less than NFLX's most basic tier. <ul><li>NFLX also has <strong>Amazon (AMZN) </strong>to contend with. Although AMZN does not break out its Prime Video numbers, all Prime members receive access to more than just video services; a bundle of other perks like free shipping, music streaming, and more also come with membership. </li></ul></li><li> Given the fierce competition, including from many other streamers like DIS's Hulu, <strong>Paramount (PARA)</strong>, and <strong>Discovery (DISCA)</strong>, NFLX's raised fee will need to be justified by giving consumers access to more than its library of TV and movie titles. </li><li>NFLX's foray into gaming may also trickle into more lucrative console and PC gaming. The company has already partnered with video game publisher <strong>Take-Two (TTWO)</strong>, which produces franchises like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>NBA 2K</em>, to bring one of its other franchises, <em>BioShock</em>, to film. </li><li> Additionally, the "Amazon" of Asia Pacific, <strong>Sea Limited (SE)</strong>, used its popular PC gaming titles to subsidize its entrance into e-commerce. In FY21, SE's video game bookings of $4.6 bln performed nearly in-line with its e-commerce revs of $5.1 bln. Although NFLX is not looking to enter the e-commerce market, we use SE as an example to point out how lucrative PC and console gaming can be. </li><li>NFLX is also exceptional at identifying engagement patterns. As data on video game download trends and user engagement starts piling in, it could be a key advantage in identifying games to focus on. Furthermore, this data could also spill over into NFLX's streaming division, helping the company's team to decide which video releases to pour additional resources into and which to begin abandoning. </li></ul><p> <strong>Bottom line, we like NFLX's move into mobile gaming</strong>. We think it can lead to many benefits for the company going forward. As its shares are down over 35% YTD, these benefits are much-needed and could be precisely what helps turn the stock around in the long run.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
