<html><body><p>Not long ago, the idea of <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) cutting prices on its ultra-popular electric vehicles seemed like a stretch and completely unnecessary. Now, price cuts have become commonplace for the leading EV maker as it looks to expand its customer base and market share amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. Yesterday, TSLA reduced its prices for its more expensive Model S and Model X vehicles by 5.3% and 9.1%,&nbsp;respectively.</p><ul><li>The price cuts on Model S and Model X, which account for about 5% of TSLA's total deliveries, come after the company slashed U.S. prices by as much as 20% on some vehicles in mid-January. Although those price cuts were a means for the Model 3 and Model Y to qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, they also amplified concerns about an erupting price war in the EV market.&nbsp;</li><li>Rewinding a bit further, TSLA lowered prices by 6-13% in China in early January, its second largest market where competition is really heating up with <strong>BYD Co</strong>. (<strong>BYDDY</strong>), <strong>NIO</strong> (<strong>NIO</strong>),<strong> Li Auto</strong> (<strong>LI</strong>), and a host of other companies. The pricing action came after a dreadful end to 2022 with shares of TSLA diving by over 45% from the beginning of November through year end as fears about waning demand clobbered the expensive stock.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>However, those fears are proving to be overblown as the pricing actions are having a major positive impact.</p><ul><li>When TSLA reported Q4 results on January 26, CEO Elon Musk stated that January saw the strongest orders on a year-to-date basis in the company's history and that orders are coming in at almost twice the rate of production. </li><li>Then, last Friday, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that February sales in China increased by&nbsp;13% from January to 74,402 vehicles with TSLA's head of global production stating that the price cuts have sparked "huge demand." Therefore, we'd expect that these new Model S and Model X price reductions will have a similar effect.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The downside is that TSLA's automotive gross margin will face more pressure as ASP's dip lower. </p><ul><li>Last quarter, automotive gross margin dove by 466 bps qtr/qtr to 25.9% and there's likely more erosion ahead in Q1. CFO Zachary Kirkhorn did comment that FY23 automotive gross margin will remain above 20%, though, so at least investors have a sense for where the floor is for margins.</li></ul><p>Overall, TSLA's price cuts are paying big dividends and are playing an important role in its mission to drive volume higher and expand its addressable market. While last week's Analyst and Investor Day was mainly deemed to be a disappointment because TSLA didn't formally announce a new lower-priced EV model, the company did reaffirm its long-term goal of 20 mln in annual deliveries. Making its prices more affordable and competitive will be a key pillar in attaining that goal.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
