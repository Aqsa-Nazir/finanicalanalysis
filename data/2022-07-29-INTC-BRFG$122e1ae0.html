<html><body><p>Heading into <strong>Intel's</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) lousy Q2 earnings report, many signs were pointing to a difficult quarter for the chip maker, including discouraging commentary from CFO David Zinsner in early June that the macroeconomic climate is weaker than expected. Those comments, which were made at a Bank of America conference, preceded a soft Q4 outlook from <strong>Micron</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>) on June 30 that was due to a sharp slowdown in the PC and laptop market. MU's downside guidance didn't necessarily come as a surprise, though, because consumer electronics retailer <strong>Best Buy</strong> (<strong>BBY</strong>) previously posted lackluster quarterly results that included an 8.0% decline in comps.<br><br>All of this evidence strongly indicated that INTC's Client Computing Group (CCG) will report bleak results this quarter. That indeed was the case as CCG revenue plunged by 25% yr/yr to $7.7 bln. With CCG revenue up by a rather pedestrian 6% in the year-earlier quarter, INTC can't fall on the excuse that it faced an unfavorable yr/yr comp. Instead, the steep downturn is tied to a combination of external and internal issues.</p><ul><li>It's well-understood that PC and laptop sales have stalled after experiencing a boom during the pandemic as the work-from-home transition unfolded. Relatedly, INTC now projects the PC total addressable market to contract by about 10% this year.</li><li>However, INTC's troubles run deeper than just a correction in the PC market. It's also clear that the company is losing market share to rivals like <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) and <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>). In fact, CEO Pat Gelsinger admitted as much during the earnings conference call, stating that the company's downwardly revised FY22 revenue guidance of $65-$68 bln (from $76 bln) is partly attributable to market share losses in the data center market.</li><li>On that note, the biggest disappointment from the report is that revenue in the Datacenter and AI Group (DCAI) segment dropped by 16% to $4.6 bln. This is a rather stunning development considering that MU reported Q3 sales growth of 50% in its data center market about a month ago.<ul><li>Demand has certainly slowed since MU's report, but not to the degree that INTC should be reporting a significant yr/yr decline in revenue. According to Gelsinger, delayed server chip releases caused some customers to turn to competitors, hurting INTC's sales.</li></ul></li><li>Execution issues and macroeconomic headwinds not only dragged revenue down, but they also applied further pressure on gross margin. The company was already facing severe margin compression due to its strategy to expand manufacturing capacity. Recall that last October, INTC said that it expects non-GAAP gross margin to dip to 51-53% over the next 2-3 years before improving. For some context, FY21 non-GAAP gross margin was 57.7%.<ul><li>After contracting by 5.7 percentage points last quarter to 53.1%, gross margin fell off a cliff this quarter, plummeting by 15 percentage points yr/yr to 44.8%.</li><li>In addition to cost pressures related to its manufacturing expansion, the decline in higher ASP server chip sales also weighed heavily on margins.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The only thing investors can hang their hats on is the premise that this may be a "kitchen sink" quarter in which INTC aired out all of the bad news. Gelsinger tried to sell analysts on that idea during the earnings call, stating that new products and improved execution will turn the tide for the struggling company. However, based on the stock action, it's apparent that investors are losing their patience with its turnaround efforts. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
