<html><body><p> <strong>PepsiCo (PEP) </strong>is looking a little flat today despite posting a solid beat-and-raise in Q3. After delivering a knockout Q2, the company's more typical earnings report for this quarter may not have left investors overly impressed, despite its stock having lost about 5% over the past four weeks. Furthermore, investors reacted similarly when <strong>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP)</strong> reaffirmed its FY21 guidance last week while expressing optimism about its ability to manage its supply chain moving forward. We think investors remain concerned about the potential for COVID variants to shut down parts of the economy as we head into colder months as well as the sticky supply chain environment. </p><p>Nonetheless, we are encouraged by PEP's FY21 guidance. In an environment rife with hurdles and uncertainty regarding the supply chain and the Delta variant, PEP still reaffirmed its FY21 earnings guidance of at least +12% to $6.20 while also raising its FY21 organic revenue growth guidance to +8% from its previous guidance of +6%<strong>.</strong> The primary reasons for the upbeat guidance are upcoming price hikes taking effect in Q4, continued momentum seen thus far in FY21, and strong international growth, which the company expects to only get better as we exit the pandemic. </p><ul><li> PEP posted EPS of $1.79, beating the consensus by $0.06. Although Q3's earnings beat was not as sizable as the $0.19 beat reported in PEP's previous quarter, the company typically only beats by low- to mid-single digits. </li><li> Revenue growth came in stronger, jumping 11.6% yr/yr to $20.19 bln. PEP is an established giant that doesn't tend to grow very quickly, so for the beverage and snack food company to post double-digit growth is quite out of character. In fact, aside from PEP's previous quarter, when it posted 20.5% yr/yr growth, it hasn't posted double-digit growth in five years. Organic revenue growth also jumped 9.0% yr/yr in Q3. </li><li>International divisions continued their strong growth from Q2; all regions outside the US and Europe experienced at least 27% yr/yr revenue growth. The biggest standout was PEP's Africa, Middle East, and South Asia segment, which saw revs leap 33% yr/yr and organic revs grow 20% yr/yr. However, it is worth pointing out that those markets are more beverage-focused, so the lack of mobility last year hampered PEP's revenue growth in those regions, leading to the huge growth numbers this quarter. Nevertheless, many countries within those regions are still implementing COVID restrictions, so there may still be plenty of room for growth moving forward. </li><li>Lastly, PEP stated that its upcoming spiked Mountain Dew beverage, in collaboration with <strong>Boston Beer Co (SAM)</strong>, will not be a hard seltzer. After SAM withdrew its FY21 guidance in early September due to much lower than expected hard seltzer sales, this comes as good news in our view, especially since it was rumored that the beverage would be in the hard seltzer category. </li></ul><p>Overall, although investors are only reacting mildly today, PEP still posted a solid earnings report. It's clear that PEP is doing a decent job managing its supply chain given its raised organic revenue guidance. Also, PEP's price hikes, which will start in Q4 and trickle into Q1, should help offset rising commodity costs. Finally, given the company's nice dividend yield of 2.8% and robust repurchase program, we remain bullish on PEP for buy-and-hold investors. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
