<html><body><p>Last week, credit card companies <strong>Mastercard</strong> (<strong>MA</strong>), <strong>Visa</strong> (<strong>V</strong>), and <strong>American Express</strong> (<strong>AXP</strong>), reported strong quarterly results, signaling that consumer spending held up quite well in the face of the Omicron variant and inflationary pressures. These encouraging reports provided bullish data points for digital payment processor <strong>PayPay</strong> (<strong>PYPL</strong>) ahead of its Q4 earnings release last night. With expectations rising that PYPL would rebound from a disappointing Q3 performance, the Fintech pioneer stumbled badly and missed EPS expectations, while issuing downside EPS and revenue guidance for 1Q22 and FY22.<br><br>The lingering impact of withdrawing from <strong>eBay's</strong> (<strong>EBAY)</strong> platform did significantly weigh on PYPL's revenue growth in Q4. In fact, excluding eBay, revenue was up 22% on a spot basis, compared to the reported growth of 13%. However, the company's issues run deeper than its exit from EBAY, as illustrated by the following points:</p><ul><li>Most troubling is PYPL's Net New Active Accounts (NNAs) guidance for FY22. After adding 48.9 mln NNAs in FY21, the company is forecasting only 15-20 mln NNAs this year. Furthermore, during the earnings conference call, CFO John Rainey stated that the company's goal of achieving NNAs of 750 mln by 2025 is no longer valid.<ul><li>Rainey and CEO Dan Schulman tried to calm investors' and analysts' concerns, commenting that the projected drop-off is partly by design as the company focuses on driving revenue per account higher. While dialing back on incentive-based marketing campaigns, minimally engaged accounts are expected to roll off.</li><li>It's notable that Q4 payment transactions per active account were actually higher by 11% yr/yr to 45.4. Perhaps the increase is mainly attributable to higher-value accounts, but the sudden shift in strategy is definitely catching many people off guard.</li><li>In light of the solid earnings reports from the credit card companies, and the magnitude of the expected drop-off in NNA growth for PYPL, it seems fair to assume that intensifying competition is taking a toll on the company.</li></ul></li><li>PYPL's issues aren't limited to fading revenue and NNA growth as non-GAAP operating margin contracted by 290 bps yr/yr to 21.8%. The company's Q1 and FY22 EPS guidance fell well short of expectations, indicating that margin pressures will continue.&nbsp;<ul><li>This concern is mitigated a bit because PYPL's FY22 earnings will be negatively impacted by higher taxes and a provision build for more normalized credit growth.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>The news isn't all bad for PYPL. For instance, Venmo's momentum remains strong with total payment volume up 29% to $60.6 bln. Additionally, the drag from EBAY will finally subside this year and PYPL will begin lapping easier yr/yr comparisons starting in 2Q22. These silver linings, though, are completely overshadowed by PYPL's soft outlook and the related competitive landscape.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
