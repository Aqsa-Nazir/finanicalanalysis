<html><body><p>Already facing very difficult yr/yr comparisons, <strong>eBay</strong> (<strong>EBAY</strong>) encountered weakening e-commerce conditions in 1Q22, leading to a disappointing earnings report and outlook from the online marketplace provider. Although EBAY managed to skirt by EPS and revenue estimates, other key metrics, such as a 17% drop (FX-Neutral) in gross merchandise volume (GMV), more accurately reflected the company's struggles. The loss of 5 mln active buyers from last quarter is further evidence that the pandemic-fueled boom in online shopping has lost its steam.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">EBAY argues that the drop in active buyers isn't concerning since the decline is mainly comprised of low-value buyers. A core facet of CEO Jamie Iannone's strategy is to tailor the platform toward higher-spending users while elevating focused categories such as collectibles, watches, shoes, and handbags. Excluding trading cards, GMV for those focused categories grew faster by nine points compared to the rest of the platform in Q1. Furthermore, EBAY notes that total GMV is up by 7% compared to its pre-COVID baseline in 1Q19.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">These are certainly valid points. However, EBAY's downside EPS and revenue guidance for Q2 and FY22 is more difficult to explain away. EBAY's reduced outlook for FY22 is especially troubling because its original guidance, provided in its Q4 report in late February, was already below expectations. <br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">A mix of factors are behind the gloomy outlook.</p><ul><li>While EBAY's direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is quite minimal, amounting to less than 1% of its global volume, the war is having a material impact on its business due to souring consumer confidence across Europe. The company estimates that in Q1, the invasion of Ukraine caused a low single-digit negative impact on its business. Considering that the invasion occurred on February 24 -- more than halfway through Q1 -- the effect will likely be more pronounced in Q2.</li><li>The war in Ukraine was like throwing gasoline on the fire. Rampant inflation, rising interest rates, and intensifying supply chain issues were already pressuring consumers before that conflict erupted.</li><li>Against this rough backdrop, EBAY will continue to invest in platform improvements, particularly related to expanding and improving its focused categories. For example, it recently launched Vault, a 31,000 square foot storage facility that will house collectibles and trading cards. Buyers and sellers will be able to securely transfer items at the time of the transaction, eliminating the need to ship or re-authenticate.<ul><li>EBAY believes that in the next few years, it can hold up to $3 bln in inventory, creating a substantial GMV and revenue growth driver.</li></ul></li><li>EBAY also continues to invest in its ads business, which is an area of strength. In Q1, promoted listings outperformed GMV growth by 19 points, increasing by 2% to $222 mln. Looking ahead, EBAY expects ad revenue to outpace GMV for the foreseeable future.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that EBAY is contending with mounting macroeconomic headwinds at the same time that shopping behaviors are returning to pre-pandemic norms. We like its strategy to focus on high-value users and focused product categories and believe this approach can work in the long run. In the meantime, though, EBAY may be in for a bumpy ride as consumers rein in discretionary spending.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
