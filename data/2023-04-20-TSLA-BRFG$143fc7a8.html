<html><body><p>The million-dollar question heading into <strong>Tesla's</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) 1Q23 earnings report was whether the electric vehicle maker's margins would at least meet expectations following a series of price cuts in the U.S. and China.</p><ul><li>Last night, investors didn't receive the answer they were looking for as automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%, while TSLA's overall gross margin of 19% fell well short of estimates. </li><li>Some may recall that CFO Zachary Kirkhorn stated that FY23 automotive gross margin should stay above 20% for FY23, but a steep drop in ASPs this quarter pushed the metric below that floor level.</li></ul><p>Despite the plunge in gross margin, TSLA still managed to meet EPS estimates. </p><ul><li>However, TSLA's profitability and cash flow on a yr/yr basis is heading in reverse. Specifically, net income and free cash flow tumbled by 22% and 80%, respectively. Making matters worse for the stock, CEO Elon Musk signaled during the earnings call that more price cuts could be on the horizon, stating that he intends to continue leveraging the company's position as a cost leader.</li><li>Essentially, Musk is creating a price war in the EV market -- whether he wants to admit it or not -- in order to protect/gain market share and grow volumes, at the expense of profits. This isn't a positive development for other EV makers, especially for up-and-coming companies like <strong>Rivian </strong>(<strong>RIVN</strong>) or <strong>Lucid Group</strong> (<strong>LCID</strong>) that are already being squeezed by manufacturing inefficiencies due to low production volumes.</li><li>It's also not a positive for TSLA -- at least, not in the short-term. The stock is not cheap, trading with a Forward P/E of nearly 50x. With the "E" component of that valuation metric set to decline, the "P" component will have to follow suit in order to avoid a valuation that truly reaches nose-bleed levels.</li></ul><p>On the positive side, TSLA did reaffirm its expectation to deliver about 1.8 mln vehicles in FY23, representing impressive yr/yr growth of 31%. </p><ul><li>In fact, just like last quarter, Musk said that the company may be able to reach the 2 mln mark this year for deliveries. Even as Musk predicts more "stormy weather" for the economy this year, he expects that demand will hold up quite well.</li><li>Additionally, Mr. Kirkhorn noted that cost reductions and improved efficiency at its new factories should support improved margins later this year. Whether those factors are enough to fully offset the price cuts and drive automotive gross margin back above 20% remains to be seen, but at least the trend for improved production efficiency is accelerating.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that TSLA's aggressive price cutting strategy is having a worse-than-feared impact on its margins and profits, which is a bad recipe for an expensive stock. From a longer-term perspective, the company's strategy to drive volume higher and extend its lead in the EV market will probably pay dividends, but it's going to be bumpy ride for investors as its profits dwindle.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
