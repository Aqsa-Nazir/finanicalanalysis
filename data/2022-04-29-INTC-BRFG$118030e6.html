<html><body><p>Yesterday, all seemed well in the semiconductor space after <strong>Qualcomm</strong> (<strong>QCOM</strong>) posted an impressive beat-and-raise report, but those good vibes are diminishing today in the wake of <strong>Intel's</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) downside 2Q22 EPS and revenue guidance. The chip giant's gloomy outlook is clouding over better-than-expected Q1 results that featured a 22% jump in revenue for its Datacenter and AI (DCAI) segment. Unlike QCOM, though, INTC is experiencing a slowdown in its core markets -- PCs, notebooks, laptops -- due to softening demand and component supply constraints resulting from COVID-related lockdowns in China.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">While battling against those unyielding supply chain issues and rising inflation, INTC is in the midst a major strategic overhaul as it looks to greatly expand its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. The company's long-term vision to rival <strong>Taiwan Semi</strong> (<strong>TSM</strong>) as the world's largest maker is compelling. However, the pathway to reaching that point includes some deep pitfalls, most notably in the form of margin compression. Recall that last October, INTC announced that it expects non-GAAP gross margin to dip to 51-53% over the next 2-3 years before improving. For some context, FY21 non-GAAP gross margin was 57.7%.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">With INTC already anticipating that its capacity expansion plans will pressure margins, the supply chain disruptions and rising costs couldn't come at a worse time. Following a 5.7 yr/yr percentage point drop in gross margin in Q1, the company is forecasting that gross margin will decline by another 130 bps sequentially in Q2 to 52%.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">INTC's gross margin performance figures to be a key story throughout the year, but its Q1 report and guidance also offered a few other important data points.</p><ul><li>The Client Computing Group (CCG), which is INTC's largest business at 56% of FY21 revenue, experienced a more profound downturn than expected, with revenue down 13% to $9.3 bln. Concerns that PC and laptops sales are slowing were seemingly confirmed; particular weakness was seen in the consumer and education markets. COVID lockdowns in Shanghai and efforts by OEMs to reduce component inventory levels exacerbated the problem.</li><li>Like last quarter, the DCAI segment capitalized on robust demand from hyperscalers (<strong>FB, MSFT, GOOG, ORCL</strong>), fueling strong sales for INTC's Xeon processors. Revenue for the group was up 22% to $6.0 bln, helping to offset the sluggish PC demand. It's worth noting, though, that DCAI lapped a favorable quarter in which revenue dove by 20%.</li><li>Surprisingly, INTC kept its FY22 guidance intact, despite its downside Q2 outlook, forecasting EPS of $3.60 and revenue of $76 bln. To achieve these targets, a significant improvement in the supply chain situation and an acceleration in PC sales must occur in 2H22. Based on the stock's reaction, it's evident that investors are skeptical that INTC will meet its guidance for the year.</li></ul><p>From a broader perspective, INTC's earnings report showed that the landscape in the semiconductor industry is uneven. Although every chip company is dealing with supply chain issues, those with more diversified end markets are better positioned to navigate through these headwinds. For INTC, its substantial exposure to the slowing PC market is upending its performance while its manufacturing expansion plans are putting a serious dent in its margins.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
