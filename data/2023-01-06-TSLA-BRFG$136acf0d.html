<html><body><p>The calendar may have flipped to 2023, but so far, the new year hasn't flipped the script for <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>), which saw its stock crash by 65% in 2022. Shares are under selling pressure once again after the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that TSLA amped up its discounts for the Model 3 and Model Y in China, turbocharging mounting concerns about waning demand for its EVs. According to the article, the price cuts range from 6-13%, representing the steepest markdowns to date.</p><ul><li>Not coincidentally, the pricing action comes after TSLA's deliveries plunged by nearly 50% on a month/month basis in December to 55,800 vehicles. Macroeconomic headwinds, most notably including those associated with COVID-19, are clearly putting a dent in TSLA's sales in China, which account for nearly a quarter of its total sales. </li><li>Perhaps more concerning, though, is that TSLA appears to be losing market share in China to a bevy of competitors such as <strong>BYD Co</strong>. (<strong>BYDDY</strong>), <strong>NIO</strong> (<strong>NIO</strong>), and <strong>Li Auto</strong> (<strong>LI</strong>).<ul><li>While TSLA's deliveries fell sharply in December, NIO and LI reported month/month delivery increases of 12% and 41%, respectively. </li><li>Meanwhile, BYD is emerging as a viable threat to someday dethrone TSLA as the world's largest EV maker. In 2022, BYD delivered more than 910,000 vehicles, more than tripling the amount from 2011, as TSLA's delivery growth slipped to about 40% from nearly 100% in 2021. BYD's more economical price points are providing it with a key advantage over TSLA. For instance, the company's ATTO 3 SUV has a list price of about $45,000, compared to roughly $65,000 for TSLA's Model Y.</li></ul></li></ul><p>TSLA's struggles aren't limited to the Chinese market. </p><ul><li>Recall that the company doubled its discount on its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the U.S. late in December. The price cut was seen as a strategy to entice would-be buyers to make a purchase now, rather than waiting for the new tax credits to kick in for 2023. </li><li>However, it's evident that the issue runs deeper than customers simply postponing their purchases. This was made clear when TSLA reported Q4 deliveries of 405,000, missing the ~418,000 consensus estimate -- even after that estimate had fallen in recent weeks.</li><li>Rising competition in the U.S. is also playing a role in TSLA's slowdown, particularly from <strong>Ford</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) and <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>), but its troubles here are more macro-related at this point. Rising interest rates in particular are putting its vehicles out of reach for an increasing number of consumers.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that TSLA is likely facing a combination of slowing topline growth and leaner automotive gross margin this year as it becomes more aggressive with its discounts. On the positive side, the stock has become much more compelling from a valuation standpoint with a forward P/E that's now south of 25x. Also, with the Cybertruck finally expected to roll out in mid-2023, the stock could have a meaningful and much-needed catalyst on the horizon.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
