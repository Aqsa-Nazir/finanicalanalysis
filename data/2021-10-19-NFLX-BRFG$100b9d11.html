<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX)</strong> is set to report Q3 results today on its website right at the close with a video call to follow at 6pm ET. Current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus is for EPS to grow 47% yr/yr to $2.56 and for revenue to grow 16% yr/yr to $7.48 bln. In July, NFLX guided to EPS of $2.55 and revenue of $7.477 bln. </p><ul><li> <strong>The most important operating metric with Netflix is global streaming net adds.</strong> NFLX has been all over the place in recent quarters. After missing prior guidance in Q3, NFLX rebounded with strong sub net add upside in Q4. However, Q1 came in below guidance while Q2 upside was minimal (+1.54 mln vs +1.00 mln prior guidance). Current guidance for Q3 is +3.50 mln, while guidance for Q4 will also be closely watched. NFLX is lapping a pretty tough +8.51 mln Q4 result last year. </li><li><strong>NFLX can be a bit volatile in terms of EPS.</strong> Last quarter, NFLX reported a pretty sizeable $0.19 EPS miss while revenue was in-line. A miss is not great to see, but we were not overly worried about it. Remember that a big driver of profitability is related to how much Netflix spends on production costs, so it's hard to predict. NFLX had paused production due to the pandemic, but is back up and running albeit with COVID protocols. Also, unlike most companies that provide a range for EPS guidance, NFLX provides just one number which we think also makes analysts' jobs more difficult when they create their models. </li><li><strong>In terms of other important metrics, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU keeps growing.</strong> Q2 came in at $14.54 vs $14.25 in Q1 and vs $13.25 a year ago. NFLX rolled out a US price increase in Q4 and now we're seeing that effect roll into the ARPU metric. </li><li> Net sub adds get most of the attention but we'd argue operating margin should get more attention because they are pretty robust. In Q2, it came in at 25.2% roughly in-line with 25.5% prior guidance. Perhaps a slight disappointment after a big beat in Q1,. NFLX guided to a bit of a dip in Q3 at 20.7%, but again, NFLX is ramping up production, which tends to reduce margins. NFLX did reaffirm its target of 20% for the full year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. </li><li><strong>Finally, the stock has been moving up nicely, up 22% since mid-August,</strong> finally breaking above a multi-month trading range in the $475-575 area since July 2020, even as other tech names were soaring. </li><li><strong>We think the recent move is due to excitement that NFLX may report some upside</strong> to global net adds for two main reasons: 1) the +3.50 mln guidance for Q3 seems low to us considering that NFLX is lapping an easy comp in 3Q20 at +2.20 mln, and 2) excitement about the surprise hit Squid Game, a South Korean survival drama series, could add a nice push to the new subscriber metric.
