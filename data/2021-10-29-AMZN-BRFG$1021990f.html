<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN -3%)</strong> isn't smiling too much after reporting a sizable Q3 earnings miss and guiding Q4 revs below consensus. The online retail Goliath's $2.84 EPS miss was the company's largest in five years. AMZN also missed on revs in the quarter as it found itself working against intense inflationary pressures and ongoing labor constraints. </p><p> This marks AMZN's second top-line miss in a row. This is quite notable, as the company seldom misses on revs, let alone for two straight quarters. Although, to be fair, AMZN's Q3 revenue of $110.81 bln did fall in-line with its prior guidance of $106-112 bln. Also, during its Q2 earnings call in late July, the company cautioned investors that it expected Prime member spending to continue to show weakness as the company lapped big leaps in spending made during the pandemic last year; AMZN expects this effect to continue heading into Q4. </p><ul><li><strong>What may have surprised investors the most was the significant jump in inflationary costs.</strong> AMZN experienced about $1 bln of inflationary pressures in Q3, primarily from wage increases. The company typically implements those increases in October but had to pull the increases forward to May to retain and attract workers. </li><li> Furthermore, AMZN saw an additional $1 bln of impact in the quarter from raw material, particularly steel, and third-party trucking inflation. Steel was a sizable cost in Q3 since the company constructed or brought online many additional fulfillment centers, sort centers, and last-mile delivery stations. However, this may not have been too surprising since AMZN noted in Q2 that it planned to bring on a lot of new capacity during the second half of the year. </li><li> Aside from supply chain headwinds, there were still some bright spots in Q3. AMZN's cloud offering, AWS, continued its robust growth, jumping 39% yr/yr to $16.1 bln. We expect AWS to keep this momentum going, especially after the pandemic ignited a further push to go digital. </li><li> In addition, AMZN recently launched a multiplayer online PC game called New World that has already become the highest-played new game on Steam (a PC video game hosting platform) this year. We like AMZN's move into video games; its Indonesian peer, <strong>Sea Limited (SE)</strong>, became the "Amazon" of Southeast Asia through revenue generated from its multiplayer online PC game, Free Fire (launched in late 2017), which is still rapidly growing its active user base. </li><li><strong>Looking ahead, along with Prime spending going against difficult comps from the year-ago period in Q4, AMZN's inflationary pressures are accelerating.</strong> The company expects around $4 bln of impact in Q4 as it works to deliver higher volumes during the holiday season. As such, AMZN is guiding to Q4 revs of $130-140 bln, slightly below analyst expectations.</li></ul><p> Heading into Q3 earnings, there was some concern that AMZN could struggle to meet expectations with mobility on the rise. For example, <strong>eBay (EBAY)</strong>, which reported Q3 earnings pre-market yesterday, saw gross merchandise volume decline as mobility continued to increase. Furthermore, many companies during earnings season thus far have struggled with finding enough workers, such as intermodal transportation company <strong>J.B. Hunt (JBHT)</strong>, forcing them to raise wages. </p><p>Lastly, after AMZN's somewhat disappointing Q2 results, the company set more realistic expectations for the coming quarters. However, the wide earnings miss in Q3 was surprising, as AMZN did not forecast meaningful inflationary impacts moving forward last quarter. With Q4 guidance factoring in double the inflationary pressures we saw in Q3, AMZN could see its stock pull back further. As such, it may be best to take a wait-and-see approach.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
