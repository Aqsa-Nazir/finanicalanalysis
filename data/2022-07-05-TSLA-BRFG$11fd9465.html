<html><body><p>As widely anticipated, <strong>Tesla's</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) deliveries slumped in 2Q22 as factory shutdowns and COVID-related lockdowns in China combined to significantly impede production. Although deliveries were up by 26% on an yr/yr basis to 254,695, the key metric slightly missed analysts' estimates and fell by 18% sequentially. In fact, this is the first qtr/qtr decline in deliveries in two years.<br><br>TSLA, which has managed to navigate around the supply chain disruptions better than most automakers, also uncharacteristically underperformed some of its main Chinese EV counterparts in Q2. For instance, <strong>NIO's</strong> (<strong>NIO</strong>) deliveries only decreased by 2% yr/yr to 25,059, while <strong>XPeng's</strong> (<strong>XPEV</strong>) deliveries were essentially flat at 34,422. Adding some salt to the wound, Warren Buffett-backed BYD sped past TSLA to become the world's largest EV maker after selling 641,000 new vehicles in 1H22.<br><br>As bad as this news sounds, it's not all doom and gloom for TSLA.</p><ul><li>The company also reported today that June 2022 was its highest vehicle production month in its history. That momentum will temporarily cease during the first two weeks of July while TSLA suspends most production at its Shanghai plant to conduct factory upgrades. However, once completed, the Shanghai facility will be capable of ramping its weekly production higher by about 5,000 vehicles to 22,000 vehicles per week.</li><li>Barring another round of lockdowns in China, TSLA is still in decent shape to reach its FY22 delivery growth goal of 50% or above. When TSLA reported Q1 results on April 20, Elon Musk conceded that Q2 production could be lower than Q1 but added that Q3 and Q4 should be substantially higher. That scenario seems to be playing out following a strong June for production.</li><li>Demand is still quite healthy, even as TSLA pushes through more price increases to offset rising costs. With prices for some raw materials cooling off a bit lately -- including those that go into making batteries -- the price increases could have a material positive impact on margins in 2H22.</li></ul><p>The wild card, though, remains an economy that Musk has a "super bad" feeling about. That negative disposition is playing out through a couple rounds of layoffs, including last week's reduction of 200 positions at TSLA's San Mateo, CA office. If macroeconomic conditions do substantially worsen, then that resilient demand will erode as even TSLA's more affluent customer base holds off on making big-ticket purchases.</p><p>The main takeaway is that a rough Q2 for production and deliveries was essentially a given, as reflected in the stock's 30% plunge since early May. What's more uncertain is whether automotive gross margin remained firm during this production slowdown. A key factor underlying TSLA's impressive earnings growth has been its improving manufacturing efficiencies, especially at its Shanghai plant. When TSLA reports earnings on July 20, it wouldn't be surprising to see a sequential decline in automotive gross margin, which expanded by 636 bps to 32.9% last quarter. Perhaps Q2 is just a bump in the road for TSLA with strong delivery growth on the horizon in 2H22, but that once unshakeable confidence from many TSLA investors is certainly being tested now.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
