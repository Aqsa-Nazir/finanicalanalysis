<html><body>Few companies are better positioned to benefit from the rapid digitization of businesses in the wake of the pandemic than FinTech pioneer <strong>PayPal</strong> (<strong>PYPL</strong>). Businesses that were hesitant to expand eCommerce channels and consumers who were uncomfortable transacting online have had little choice but to make the digital transition. Waiting in the wings has been PYPL, which reported strong, upside 4Q20 results last night, driven by the addition of 16 mln net new accounts (NNAs) and a 39% spike in total payment volume (TPV) to $277 bln.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This surge in online transactions is a well-known catalyst, explaining why the stock has soared by ~150% since the virus hit the U.S. last March. Accordingly, PYPL was facing elevated expectations heading into its report last night. By exceeding top and bottom-line estimates and providing solid guidance for 1Q21 and FY21, including the expectation of adding ~50 mln accounts this year, PYPL hurdled the high bar. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However, PYPL's impressive performance isn't the only development that's garnering attention. During the earnings conference call last night, CEO Dan Schulman highlighted the company's plans regarding cryptocurrencies. Given the astronomical run that Bitcoin has recently made, nearly doubling since early last December, investors' ears naturally perked up. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">PYPL already provides some cryptocurrency capabilities after launching buy, hold, and sell experiences last October. This year, the company will significantly build upon that initial offering by enabling cryptocurrency to be used as a funding source to make payments. For PYPL's 29 mln merchants around the globe, no additional integrations or fees will be assessed, as all transactions will be settled in fiat currency. The company expects the rollout to begin later this quarter.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This offering puts PYPL at the forefront of cryptocurrency's rising popularity. In fact, Schulman stated that customers who purchase cryptocurrencies have been logging into their PYPL accounts twice as frequently as before the purchases.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bolstering cryptocurrency capabilities is like icing on the cake for a business that's already humming. In Q4, payment transactions grew by 17% to 4.4 bln, despite facing a stiff headwind in the travel and event categories, which experienced a 30% yr/yr decline. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In addition to the jump in NNAs, two other key factors stand out. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First, the reopening of economies around the world has fostered stronger cross border trade (CBT). In Q4, CBT increased by 31% to $46 bln, with particular strength seen in European corridors. In comparison, CBT was up a much more modest 10% in Q1 when the pandemic began sweeping across the world.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Second, Venmo continues to generate robust growth, as volume increased by 60% to $47 bln, nearly matching last quarter's 61% growth. PYPL has no intention of easing off the gas pedal, with plans of launching new Venmo capabilities later this year, including a digital wallet and cryptocurrency payments.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With an array of company-specific catalysts and favorable secular trends in its corner, PYPL shouldn't have much trouble achieving its 17% EPS and revenue growth targets for FY21. Unless another economic shock blindsides the company, it's hard to imagine that PYPL won't continue posting solid results in the coming quarters.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
