<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN +5%)</strong> was Amazing with its Q2 earnings <a bhref="https://www.briefing.com/InPlayEq/NewsFeed/newsdoc?id=646013" target="_blank">report</a> last night. It reported a huge beat-and-raise, plus its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment did quite well also, allaying fears of a slowdown in that business.  </p><p><strong>While everyone knew sales would be gangbusters with so many consumers staying home and ordering online, there were some concerns about the EPS line</strong>, as AMZN was getting hit by a lot of additional costs related to COVID-19, including through its hiring 175,000 new employees plus a loss of efficiency resulting from workers having to social distance and undergo testing, implementing additional cleaning, etc. However, Amazon came through with a huge beat on EPS. Also, operating income, a closely watched metric, rose 89.5% yr/yr to $5.84 bln, well above prior guidance of $(1.5)-1.5 bln and current consensus of $1.13 bln. </p><p> <strong>We also had a concern that the Q3 guidance </strong>could be a bit more subdued, as perhaps Q2 was being seen as a one-time bump from pandemic buying. However, with Q3 revenue guidance of $87-93 bln vs. $86.36 bln consensus, that fear was quickly put to bed. Not only that, but the mid-point of the Q3 operating income guidance of $2-5 bln is above consensus of $2.90 bln, signaling that Amazon is doing fine on the profitability end as well. AMZN does not guide for EPS, but operating income is a decent proxy for profitability.  </p><p><strong>Turning to AMZN's highly profitable Amazon Web Services (AWS) </strong>cloud computing offering, we had concerns here going in as well. Most consumers interact with AMZN in terms of shopping, but its AWS service, while not the largest factor in terms of total revenue (13% of 1H20 revenue), generated more operating income in 1H20 than AMZN's North America and International shopping segments combined -- so it's a big deal. </p><p> Last week, <strong>Microsoft's (MSFT) </strong>competing Azure offering saw growth slow a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. That took a bite out of MSFT's stock price and made us nervous heading into AMZN's report. AWS segment sales rose 29% yr/yr to $10.81 bln, which was a bit of a slowdown from +33% growth in Q1, but it was not nearly as severe as Azure's slowdown. Plus, Q2 AWS operating margin was 31.1%, a nice bump from 25.3% a year ago. All in all, AWS did just fine. </p><p> <strong>Bottom line, this was a gangbusters quarter for AMZN</strong> as its shopping segment was even better than hoped while AWS hung in there quite well. With the stock having made a nearly +90% move since mid-March, we were a bit nervous, but AMZN came through yet again. The only thing that would have made this a perfect quarter is if AMZN had announced a stock split like <strong>Apple (AAPL) </strong>did last night.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
