<html><body><strong>Tesla's</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) rough ride in China became even bumpier this weekend after the Wall Street Journal reported that China's State Administration for Market Regulation issued a recall for nearly every TSLA vehicle sold in the country. The recall, which involves about 247,000 Model 3s and nearly 39,000 Model Ys, is related to a safety issue concerning the vehicles' autopilot systems. Specifically, an investigation determined that the autopilot system could be accidentally automated, causing the vehicle to accelerate unexpectedly.<br><br>This development comes at a sensitive time for TSLA following a pair of recent public relations hits in China. In March, the Chinese government banned TSLA's vehicles from entering military installations due to concerns that sensitive data could be captured by cameras and sensors on the EVs. The accusation likely created some distrust among Chinese consumers.<br><br>One month later, a disgruntled customer made a major spectacle during a Shanghai auto show by climbing on top of a TSLA vehicle and showing a video of an accident that allegedly resulted from faulty brakes. The incident went viral as the media and social media outlets highlighted a multitude of complaints regarding poor service and repair capabilities at TSLA.<br><br>Accounting for roughly a third of TSLA's business and representing the company's most important growth driver, China is a vital component of TSLA's overall strategy. So far, the public relations troubles don't appear to be making a lasting impact on sales. In May, the company sold 33,463 China-made vehicles, up 29% from April. The performance was a significant improvement from April, when sales fell by 27% from March to 25,845.<br><br>It remains to be seen whether this recall will have a more pronounced effect, but we believe the news may not be as bad as the headlines suggest.<br><br>For instance, the action may be classified as a software update rather than an actual recall. Vehicles will not need to go to service centers for repairs since the fix simply requires owners to update their software. Therefore, unlike a recall that involves mechanical repairs, this isn't a very costly event for TSLA.<br><br>Perhaps TSLA will experience a short-term downtick in sales as the news reverberates throughout China. However, it's hard to imagine that the so-called recall will cause any permanent damage to TSLA's growth opportunities in China, the largest EV market in the world. For context, research firm LMC Automotive estimates that by 2028, China will be making over eight million EVs per year, compared to just 1.4 mln EVs for North America.<br><br>The main takeaway is that there is some concern that TSLA's reputation is cracking a bit in China following a string of public relations issues. However, given TSLA's popularity and the massive size of the EV market in China, we believe that the financial damage will likely be minimal.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
