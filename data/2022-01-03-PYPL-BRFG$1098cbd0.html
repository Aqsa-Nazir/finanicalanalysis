<html><body><p><strong>PayPal (PYPL +3%)</strong> finds a pal in BMO Capital today after the firm upgraded PYPL to Outperform with a price target of $224, or about 15% above current levels. BMO Capital noted that the payment processing company's roughly 20% fall during 2021 "went too far," citing that PYPL is set up "constructively" for 2022. </p><p> Over the past three quarters, PYPL endured a series of revenue misses and downside quarterly guidance, raising concerns over whether the company's issues stem beyond the unwinding of its <strong>eBay (EBAY)</strong> business. A pandemic darling, PYPL had seen its shares more than double during 2020, making the revenue misses in 2021 all the more shocking to investors.  PYPL was not alone in facing a challenging 2021. Other payment processors, such as <strong>Block (SQ)</strong> and <strong>Global Payments (GPN)</strong>, saw even more pronounced declines in the year. A major culprit was a significant drop-off in online spending, especially as foot traffic began to recover to pre-pandemic levels. For example, PYPL's total payment volume (TPV) grew just 8.7% to $310 bln from Q1 to Q3, with only 0.3% sequential growth in Q3. </p><p> However, with 2021 now in the rearview mirror, PYPL can set its sights on what looks to be a much friendlier year. </p><ul><li>One reason for this is that PYPL users can pay with Venmo on <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> starting this year. Venmo is already proving to be PYPL's fastest-growing product, recording a 36% jump yr/yr in TPV in Q3, with $900 mln expected in sales for FY21. Even though $900 mln represents just 3.5% of total estimated FY21 sales, the AMZN deal should lead to a significant boost in revs and TPV in FY22. </li><li> Furthermore, PYPL also announced in Q3 that <strong>Walmart (WMT)</strong> now presents PayPal as a checkout option for its grocery and marketplace business, adding more fuel to Venmo's growth. </li><li> Along with Venmo's potentially massive growth in FY22, PYPL's Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service, launched in August 2020, has quickly catapulted to over $5.4 bln in TPV; over a third of that came in Q3 alone. Now that PYPL has closed on its $2.7 bln purchase of Japan-based BNPL platform Paidy, we believe 2022 will see meaningful growth in PYPL's BNPL service. </li></ul><p> Bottom line, 2021 presented its share of hurdles for PYPL. However, in FY22, the company will no longer face the difficulty of lapping unfavorable numbers. Also, retail spending remains high, as evidenced by early holiday season reports. Thus, investors will be expecting solid FY22 guidance when PYPL reports earnings, presumably around February 4. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
