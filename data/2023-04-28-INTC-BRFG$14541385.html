<html><body><p>A cynic might say that beleaguered chip maker <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) actually posted dismal 1Q23 results and that the stock is rallying simply because it hurdled rock bottom expectations with shares down by more than 40% since early 2022. Afterall, revenue did collapse by 36% yr/yr -- its worse decline in over five years -- and Non-GAAP gross margin continued to tumble lower, falling by nearly 15 percentage points on a yr/yr basis to 38.4%. We can't argue with those facts, but we do believe there is another reason why the stock is jumping higher, other than being ripe for a bounce after its freefall.</p><ul><li>For the past few quarters, investors and analysts have been looking for signs of a bottoming in INTC's financials and its PC end market. The company's 1Q23 report revealed some green shoots, indicating that its business may finally be stabilizing as it attempts to claw back market share losses and the hands of rival <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>).</li><li>For starters, INTC issued inline Q2 revenue guidance of $11.5-$12.5 bln. That may not seem like much of an accomplishment, until considering that INTC issued downside revenue guidance in every quarter last year. <ul><li>Furthermore, the midpoint of its guidance equates to a yr/yr decline of about 21.5%, representing an improvement from this quarter's nosedive. Again, a small, but notable win for INTC.</li></ul></li><li>In the PC-centric Client Computing Group (CCG) segment, revenue sank by 38% to $5.8 bln as INTC's OEM customers continue to work through inventory amid a soft demand environment.<ul><li>According to research firm IDC, PC shipments decreased by 29% in Q1, continuing a  fallout in the wake of a pandemic-driven boom. </li><li>However, during the earnings call, CEO Pat Gelsinger stated that he's seeing signs of stability in the PC market with inventory corrections proceeding as anticipated. </li><li>He added that, due to that surge in demand during the pandemic, that the PC usage and installed base is about 10% higher that pre-COVID levels, which bodes well for INTC when users refresh their PCs.</li></ul></li><li>The news isn't quite as bullish on the server side. Revenue in the Datacenter and AI (DCAI) segment plunged by 39%, mainly driven by soft demand from enterprises and international markets. <ul><li>In Q1, server consumption TAM declined on both a sequential and yr/yr basis and INTC continues to expect another yr/yr decline in Q2. </li><li>The silver lining is that the company still expects a modest recovery in 2H23, with enterprise and international recovering at an accelerated rate.</li></ul></li><li>INTC's slumping gross margins, which have been battered by a combination of rising investments in its IDM 2.0 strategy (building out its factory network) and the chip correction cycle, are expected to dip again in Q2. </li><li>Specifically, INTC guided for Non-GAAP gross margin of 37.5%, down 90 bps from Q1. That may seem like more bad news, but the drop is far less severe than the 540 bps decline experienced in Q1, adding to the notion that business is starting to stablize.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that this was far from a strong performance for INTC, reflecting ongoing weakness in its core markets, but a poor report was widely anticipated. Therefore, the focal point rested on whether INTC has reached the bottom of this painful downturn. Using that criterion as a benchmark, the earnings report and outlook hit the mark -- as low of a target as it may have been.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
