<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN -7%)</strong> has left investors a bit lost in the jungle. Known for its huge beat-and-raise quarters, the online retail giant stumbled with its Q2 earnings report last night, and investors are punishing the stock. Amazon reported another big EPS beat, but revenue was light of consensus. The guidance was perhaps even more troubling; Q3 revenue and operating income both came in below expectations. </p><p>In fairness, its Q2 revenue at $113.08 bln was right in the middle of prior guidance of $110-116 bln, but it was below consensus of $115.08 bln. The size of the miss was not that large, relatively speaking, but it was still shocking to see considering that Prime Day fell in Q2 this year. We had to double check the numbers - a top-line miss is very rare for AMZN. </p><ul><li><strong>So what happened?</strong> Amazon was candid on the call, saying that Q2 was a transition period for many customers. As the quarter progressed, "people were at home less as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of [AMZN's] largest geographies, including the US and much of Europe." As a result, growth in Prime member spend moderated compared to spending seen during the peak of the pandemic. Since May 15, excluding Prime Day, growth rates dropped into the mid-teens, and the Q3 guidance reflects an expected continuation of this trend. </li><li>While not providing guidance beyond Q3, Amazon did say it expects that this pattern of difficult yr/yr revenue comps to continue for the next few quarters. </li><li><strong>While online shopping fell a bit short, its AWS segment had another terrific quarter.</strong> AWS segment sales rose 37% yr/yr to $14.81 bln, an acceleration from +32% in Q1 and +28% in Q4. The pandemic has caused many people to reassess their IT needs, and many have decided that they do not want to own and run their own data centers.</li><li> <strong>At Briefing.com, we like to pay close attention to margins.</strong> So we admittedly were quite troubled when AMZN guided to Q3 operating income of just $2.5-6.0 bln vs $8.18 bln consensus. AMZN explained that the pull-forward in demand seen over the past 18 months required and still requires large investments in its fulfillment network. And as usual, most of its annual spend occurs in the second half of the year ahead of the holidays. </li><li> <strong>Another factor is the very competitive labor market.</strong> The wage increase Amazon normally implements in October was pulled forward into May. AMZN is spending a lot on signing bonuses and incentives. The good news is that AMZN has very good staffing levels, unlike <strong>FedEx (FDX)</strong>, which recently said it's having trouble with labor availability. </li></ul><p>Coming into this report, we expected another big beat-and-raise, especially given that Prime Day was timed to act as a catalyst in Q2. We thought we'd be focusing more on the new CEO and any possible change in strategy. However, the big story is the revenue miss and lackluster guidance. AMZN concedes that it did not adequately factor in the increase in mobility. People are getting vaccinated and getting out of the house, which takes away from online shopping time. Overall, we are not too concerned about the numbers. The good thing is that AMZN has now set more realistic expectations for the coming quarters, so a miss in the future looks less likely.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
