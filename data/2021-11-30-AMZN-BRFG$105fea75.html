<html><body><p>Although <strong>Amazon (AMZN -1%)</strong> is succumbing to selling pressure with the overall market today, its future regarding Amazon Web Services (AWS) is anything but cloudy. The online e-commerce mammoth and public cloud services company outlined new AWS services today, including Mainframe Modernization, Private 5G, IoT FleetWise, and IoT TwinMaker. While AMZN's Q3 earnings report from late October was mired in a massive EPS miss and a revenue shortfall relative to analysts' expectations, the company's cloud services offering was a ray of sunshine that shone through an otherwise cloudy report. </p><p>In Q3, AWS sales leaped 39% yr/yr on 30% operating margins despite lapping 29% growth from the year-ago period. On a two-year stack, AWS revs increased 79%. Although Microsoft's Azure <strong>(MSFT)</strong> boasted 135% growth over that same period, Azure's margins are unclear as MSFT includes it in its Intelligence Cloud segment, which encompasses many different cloud services. Also, Intelligence Cloud is MSFT's main business, making up over a third of total revenue, whereas AWS is the smallest component of AMZN's total sales. </p><p> However, despite AWS forming AMZN's smallest segment, its revenue of $16.1 bln in Q3 was nearly on par with MSFT's Intelligence Cloud revenue of $16.9 bln during the same period, showing the magnitude of AMZN's cloud services. We think that AWS will be the primary driver of future growth as businesses accelerate the pace at which they go digital, making cloud adoption necessary. </p><p> AMZN's announcement today of new AWS services only furthers our bullish view. </p><ul><li> The biggest news was AWS Mainframe Modernization, which AMZN notes will speed up customers' mainframe migration to the cloud. One of the biggest hurdles businesses face in transitioning to the cloud is that many companies have a mainframe computer -- or a dedicated server -- on-premise that hosts many different applications and functions. Shifting an on-premise server to the cloud can be costly and time-consuming. With AWS Mainframe Modernization, AMZN is looking to convert hesitant businesses to using AWS by allowing firms to reuse their current code, which can cut down on cost and time. </li><li>We think that IoT Fleetwise also has massive potential, especially as automakers improve autonomous driving features. The standout with IoT Fleetwise is that it can collect and standardize data across millions of vehicles, which will be vital in gaining insights on how to improve autonomous driving as well as enhance safety features and perform diagnostic tests remotely. </li></ul><p>Overall, although the new features to AWS appear to be relatively minor, they are crucial in maintaining market share, especially as AMZN's biggest competitors, MSFT and <strong>Google (GOOG)</strong>, continue to improve and expand their cloud services. Given the switching costs companies face when deciding whether to move from one public cloud to another, having the first-mover advantage is critical, and AMZN's new AWS services should provide a solid boost in that regard. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
