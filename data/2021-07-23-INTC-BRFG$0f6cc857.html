<html><body><p> <strong>Intel (INTC -6%)</strong> is not looking too chipper today even though the company reported nice upside with its Q2 results/guidance last night. While the headline EPS and revenue numbers were better than expected, Intel's commentary sounded a bit cautious. </p><ul><li>The PC-centric segment (CCG) performed well; revenue grew 6% yr/yr to $10.1 bln amid sustained strength in client demand. The ecosystem is back to shipping over 1 mln PC units a day despite component shortages. Intel was pretty bullish on PC demand and expects PC TAM growth to continue in 2022 and beyond. </li><li>Intel makes the point that PC density, or PCs per household, has been increasing due to the way that COVID has "irreversibly" changed how people work/learn. Many companies are opting for hybrid work models, which often require a worker to have two computers. Replacement cycles are also shortening on a larger and aging installed base. Also, global penetration rates are increasing as PCs become more affordable. Intel sees huge potential in areas like education, as PCs per hundred students remains in the single digits. </li><li>Revenue in Intel's other major segment, data center (DCG), fell 9% yr/yr to $6.5 bln. Intel does expect momentum to increase through the year, targeting achievement of double-digit yr/yr growth in 2H21. </li></ul><p><strong>The stock's move lower is, in our view, mostly tied to Intel's near-term outlook.</strong> Specifically, the strong demand environment continues to stress the supply chain. The good news is that Intel expects the shortages to bottom out in 2H21; however, the not-so-good news is that it may take another 1-2 years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand. Investors may be focusing on that latter point. Demand looks great, but supply constraints should be a headwind for a long while. </p><p><strong>Another concern we have is that Intel is really ramping up its production capacity, </strong>with major fab construction projects underway in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland, and Israel. While it's good that Intel is ramping capacity during a chip shortage, its ramp will take time and money and impact margins. We are still a little surprised that earlier this year Intel decided to sort of double down on being a chip manufacturer. We thought it could be better to follow a more fabless route and farm out production to third parties. Intel chose the other way, and time will tell if that was the right decision. </p><p><strong>Bottom line, the Q2 numbers/guidance were sound</strong>, but investors need to understand that supply constraints will remain an issue for some time. Also, continued weakness on the data center side makes us wonder if <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong> is taking market share.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
