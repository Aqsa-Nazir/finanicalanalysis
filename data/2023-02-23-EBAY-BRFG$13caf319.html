<html><body><p><strong>eBay (EBAY -5%) </strong>is struggling to entice many bidders today despite surpassing analyst earnings and sales estimates in Q4. The online auction and shopping platform also piled on several other highlights, including Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) that exceeded prior projections, an upbeat Q1 revenue forecast, and a 14% quarterly dividend hike. At the same time, the midpoint of EBAY's Q1 earnings outlook met analyst targets. </p><p> <strong>So why are investors unimpressed?</strong> EBAY did not provide its full-year expectations, as it did in prior quarters, due to the "dynamic operating environment." Management did outline some of its thoughts on how 2023 may play out, but it was primarily bearish. Its baseline expectation is that demand does not materially improve during 1H23 due to lingering uncertainty across the company's largest markets. Conversely, EBAY sees potential for improving underlying economic conditions as the year progresses but noted that it is still too early to confidently predict a second-half recovery. </p><p>Leading into EBAY's Q4 report, <strong>we spotlighted the importance of the company's FY23 outlook aligning with its Investor Day predictions detailed in March 2022</strong>. Last quarter, management remained confident in achieving its goals of adjusted EPS growing roughly +10% yr/yr in FY23, accelerating to mid-teens growth in FY24, GMV climbing +4% yr/yr in FY23, accelerating to +5% in FY24, and revs outpacing GMV for the foreseeable future, driven by the company's payments and ads businesses. As such, the lack of confidence just three months later is discouraging. </p><ul><li><strong>Still, EBAY did touch on a few of these points</strong>. Ads and payments were solid in Q4, with first-party advertising products, mainly Promoted Listings, delivering $276 mln of revenue, a 19% jump yr/yr, easily outpacing GMV, which slipped 12% to $18.2 bln. EBAY stated that it is tracking nicely towards its Investor Day targets, resulting in the businesses likely outpacing GMV growth in FY23.</li><li> GMV growth in FY23 was less clear. Management stated that the timing of its GMV framework outlined at Investor Day was a function of the potential severity and duration of the current economic climate. </li><li> Adjusted EPS for the year was also hazy. Management did not delve into details beyond its comprehensive Q1 guidance, only mentioning that its priority in 2023 is to offset share dilution while continuing to balance the company's capital needs. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, without formal guidance reiterating EBAY's long-term Investor Day targets, investors are proceeding with caution today. The unclear outlook also casts a dark cloud on otherwise decent Q4 results, which showed notable improvements over prior quarters, such as stabilization in active buyers and excellent advertising growth. Still, although EBAY is not immune to inflationary pressures, its auction format is attractive for consumers looking for the best bang for their buck, which could prove the difference in FY23. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
