<html><body><p><strong>Intel (INTC -8%)</strong> is not looking too chipper today with the stock down big after reporting Q4 results/guidance last night. It was pretty bad all the way around with a miss on EPS and revs. In addition, Intel guided to a loss in Q1 while analysts were expecting a profit and Intel's Q1 revenue guidance of $10.5-11.5 bln was well below analyst expectations. </p><ul><li> What jumped out at us as a bit alarming was that non-GAAP gross margin declined to 43.8% from 55.8% last year. That was below prior guidance of 45.0%. Perhaps more troubling was Intel guiding to a huge sequential decline in Q1 at just 39.0%. </li><li>It does not sound like the business will turn around soon. Intel expects macro weakness to persist at least through the first half of the year, with the possibility of second-half improvements. Factors impacting results are general macro uncertainty, rising rates, geopolitical tensions in Europe, and COVID impacts in Asia, especially in China. </li><li> In the PC market, Intel says it saw further deterioration as it ended 2022. On the last call in October, Intel said it expected 2023 PC consumption TAM of 270-295 mln units. But now, the company expects the lower end of that range as a more likely outcome. Customers are working down current inventories rather than buying new chips. The silver lining is that PC usage data remains strong and its installed base is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels. Also, Intel says it grew share in 2H22 and expects that positive momentum to continue in 2023. </li><li>In the server market, inventory burn drove server CPU shipments down mid-single-digits in 2022, with hyperscale up, offset by declines in enterprise and rest of world. Intel expects Q1 server consumption TAM to decline both sequentially and yr/yr at an accelerated rate, with 1H23 server consumption TAM down yr/yr before returning to growth in 2H23. While all segments have weakened, enterprise and rest of world, especially China, continues to be weaker than hyperscale. </li></ul><p> In our preview yesterday, we recommended caution heading into this report, but the final result was even worse than we expected and the troubles seem like they will linger through 1H23 at least. The big miss, significant downside guidance in Q1 and margin compression are all worrying signs. This report is dragging down many chip names today, including close rivals <strong>AMD, NVDA</strong>. It is also bad news for the chip equipment space. </p><p>Some analysts are now raising concerns about cash, so we were a little surprised to not see a dividend cut. Intel pays a huge 5.3% yield. Management was asked about it on the call and said it's committed to maintaining a competitive dividend. However, we think it may get cut at some point.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
