<html><body><p><strong>eBay (EBAY)</strong> is bidding modestly higher today on a Reuters <a bhref="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ebay-classifieds-m-a/ebay-nears-10-billion-sale-of-classified-ads-unit-sources-idUSKCN24H2HR" target="_blank">report</a> that eBay has called a board meeting, scheduled for Friday, to select a buyer for its classified ads business in a deal potentially worth up to $10 bln. This development does not come as a big surprise, given that eBay has previously announced that would undertake a strategic review of the struggling Classifieds segment.</p><p> If a deal does materialize, it would be eBay's second large sale of 2020. In February, eBay closed on the $4 bln sale of its StubHub ticketing businesses to Viagogo, a European rival.  </p><p>Furthermore, it would be a notable early move for eBay's new CEO, Jamie Iannone, who took the helm on April 27. Mr. Iannone has a strong eCommerce background, as he was most recently COO of Walmart (WMT) eCommerce. Walmart has been roundly commended for its eCommerce strategy in recent years, as it has battled online competitors like Amazon with good success. </p><p>Before that, Mr. Iannone served as CEO of SamsClub.com, the eCommerce unit for the $57 bln Sam's Club, where he was responsible for the unit's digital transformation. Our point here is that, with his eCommerce track record, if he signs off on a deal like this, he would certainly be given the benefit of the doubt that he knows what he's doing. </p><p>Another aspect to this is the fact that eBay's Classifieds segment has been struggling for some time. Shedding it would allow the company to focus on its core Marketplaces segment, which has seen a boom in transactions since the pandemic started. Last month, eBay announced that active buyer growth is accelerating, with approximately 6 mln new and reactivated buyers added in April and May. Also, since March 2020, tens of thousands of small business sellers have been added to the platform. </p><p>Overall, we view this potential sale as a welcome development. eBay's Marketplaces segment is booming right now, and we think that's where the focus should be. In terms of why the stock is not higher on this news, investors should be aware that the stock has already more than doubled since late March, so a sale was probably already priced in.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
