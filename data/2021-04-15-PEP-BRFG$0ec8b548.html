<html><body>At this time last year, the pandemic-related behavioral shifts that we are now accustomed to were really taking hold, including the work-from-home (WFH) transition that has significantly altered eating and cooking habits. For beverage and snack food companies like <strong>PepsiCo</strong> (<strong>PEP</strong>), the stay-at-home situation generated a boom in business in the large store format channel as consumers loaded up their pantries and refrigerators. As a result, PEP posted its strongest top-line growth rate in over five years in 1Q20, creating very challenging yr/yr comparisons in the process.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Against that backdrop, PEP delivered 1Q21 results that comfortably exceeded expectations, driven by tight cost controls and market share gains in both the snack and beverage businesses.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Throughout the pandemic, PEP's Frito-Lay North America division has delivered solid growth as workers and e-learners stockpiled snacks at home. Not surprisingly, the growth rate has been slipping as mobility increases and as some people return to office settings. After registering an organic revenue increase of 6% in 3Q20, growth slid to 5% last quarter and then to 3% in 1Q21. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Not only is Frito-Lay facing difficult yr/yr comparisons, but the foodservice channel continues to struggle with business declining by double-digit rates again. Office and school cafeterias, sports and entertainment venues, transportation centers, and hotels are still far from operating at pre-pandemic levels.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The better news is that PEP believes it gained market share in the macro snack and salty snack categories, led by strength in well-known brands like Ruffles, Tostitos, and Doritos. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Similarly, the company states that it gained share in the carbonated soft drinks, teas, juices, and sparkling water categories, facilitating 2% organic revenue growth for PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA). While the revenue increase is modest, what stands out is that PBNA generated a 23% jump in core constant currency operating profit, despite experiencing disruptions from weather-related events. To put this improvement into perspective, consider that PBNA's operating profit fell by 24% in the year ago quarter, even though organic revenue was up 6%.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">CEO Ramon Laguarta credits the company's execution on its holistic cost management program for the increase in operating profit. Key components of this initiative include improving the utilization of assets, increasing automation, simplifying and redesigning workflows, and reducing non-labor costs.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Moving ahead, challenging yr/yr comparisons will continue throughout the year, but PEP did reaffirm its expectations for a mid-single-digit increase in organic revenue and a high-single-digit increase in core constant currency EPS in FY21. This projection assumes that vaccination efforts will accelerate, benefiting the foodservice channel, while pandemic-related behavioral shifts sustain the strength underpinning the large format channel.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In a testament to its solid execution and strong brand names, PEP was able to overcome unfavorable yr/yr comparisons and significant weather-related disruptions to deliver better-than-expected results. The decelerating growth in the Frito-Lay segment may be keeping a lid on shares today, though, as the gradual reopening of offices and businesses takes some steam out of the WFH-related momentum.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
