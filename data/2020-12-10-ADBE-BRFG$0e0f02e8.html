<html><body><p><strong>Adobe (ADBE +1%)</strong> wrapped up FY20 on a strong note after it <a bhref="https://www.briefing.com/InPlayEq/NewsFeed/newsdoc?id=827278" target="_blank">reported</a> impressive Q4 (Nov) earnings results this morning. Adobe has now posted three consecutive double-digit EPS beats since the pandemic began, making it clear that Adobe is benefiting from the pandemic, which has spurred more companies and consumers to shift to digital document creation. </p><ul><li>Adobe reported strong upside relative to analyst expectations for both EPS and revenue. It looks like the momentum will carry into FY21: Adobe guided well above consensus for both Q1 (Feb) and FY21. </li><li>Digital Media, which represents Adobe's largest segment and which includes Adobe Document Cloud, saw revenue jump 20% yr/yr to $2.50 bln. Furthermore, the Q1 guidance for this segment points to an acceleration in Q1 (+26% yr/yr). </li><li>Adobe notes that entire industries, from media and entertainment to pharma, retail, automotive, and financial services, have had to pivot nearly overnight to digital operations amid the disruptions of the pandemic. Electronic workflows and signatures are the only way to efficiently complete business transactions under such conditions. This reality has created new tailwinds for Adobe. </li><li>In particular, Adobe Document Cloud helps people create, edit, share, and sign digital documents with Acrobat and PDF. While digital documents have long been a part of the equation in the workplace, they have now become central to businesses operating remotely. </li><li> Also, the shift to at-home working and learning has created a heightened sense of urgency among all companies to accelerate their digital transformations. Companies of all sizes have shifted every aspect of their customer relationships towards digital. </li><li>Beyond the area of document creation, Adobe is seeing heightened demand on its Creative Cloud side, which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Lightroom, and InDesign. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, Adobe has to be right up there in terms of the top software names tailor-made for the pandemic.</strong> (<strong>DocuSign [DOCU]</strong> is another that comes to mind.) With people working from remote locations, digital document creation is now more essential than ever. And based on Adobe's robust FY21 guidance, this momentum is clearly going to continue for a while. </p><p> Even after the pandemic, we think that a lot of the gains Adobe has captured will endure as it's unlikely businesses go back to paper methods. On a final note, the stock is trading roughly flat on this report. However, we think that's more a function of the stock having run 90% from its March lows rather than anything wrong in this report.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
