<html><body><p>The semiconductor space has been a hot-spot for M&amp;A activity as companies reshape product portfolios to match emerging technology trends, while also taking advantage of high stock prices and strong financial positions. This morning,&nbsp;<strong>Intel </strong>(<strong>INTC</strong>) agreed to sell its NAND memory business for $9 bln to South Korea's <strong>SK Hynix</strong>, becoming the latest companies in the industry to strike a deal.<br><br>This deal comes on the heels of <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) blockbuster acquisition of <strong>Arm Holdings</strong> in September, and <strong>Analog Devices</strong>' (<strong>ADI</strong>) buy-out of <strong>Maxim Integrated</strong> (<strong>MXIM</strong>) in July. Furthermore, on October 9, the <a bhref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amd-is-in-advanced-talks-to-buy-xilinx-11602205553?mod=hp_lead_pos3" target="_blank"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported</a> that <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) is in advanced talks to acquire <strong>Xilinx</strong> (<strong>XLNX</strong>), although a deal hasn't come to fruition yet.<br><br>Consolidation  is a positive development for an industry that is prone to volatile pricing dynamics. With at least six major semiconductor companies producing memory chips, the oversupply and commoditization of chips can result in steep price declines when demand turns south.<br><br>The ramp-up in deal-making is lifting the stock prices of other names in the industry, including <strong>Micron</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>), <strong>Western Digital</strong> (<strong>WDC</strong>), and <strong>Seagate Technology</strong> (<strong>STX</strong>), as the prospects of further consolidation boosts their values.<br><br>INTC's divestiture of its NAND business is interesting because that segment has generated strong results recently. In Q2, its Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG) posted robust growth of 76%, driven by strong NAND bit growth and improved pricing.<br><br>A primary catalyst fueling the impressive growth is the ever-increasing amount of data being moved to the cloud. This trend has turbo-charged demand from public cloud operators and data center companies. <br><br>However, it's a relatively small business for INTC. For FY20, the NAND&nbsp;unit is on pace to deliver revenue of ~$6.4 bln, representing less than 10% of total expected revenue for the year. As a non-core asset, the NAND business doesn't fit into INTC's longer-term growth strategy, especially given the erratic nature of NAND prices and margins.<br><br>Instead, INTC intends to focus on opportunities in advanced technology such as AI, 5G, and intelligent edge.&nbsp;In particular, the company is excited about its higher-margin Xeon processors, which INTC says&nbsp;is foundational for data center AI.</p><p>During the Q2 earnings conference call on July 23,  CEO Robert Swan commented, "AI use cases are becoming pervasive and we are embedding AI capability into all our products." The proceeds from this deal with Hynix will be reinvested in these new AI-enabled products.&nbsp;<br><br>Given the subdued initial reaction to this deal, it seems investors are skeptical about the idea of shedding a business that's poised to benefit from data center and mobile phone growth in FY21. The disappointment is understandable, but from a big picture perspective, INTC's focus on higher-margin advanced chips that support emerging technologies makes sense.&nbsp;</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
