<html><body><p><strong>Intel's</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) earnings for 3Q22 surprisingly exceeded expectations by a wide margin, even as revenue declined by 15% yr/yr and as gross margin contracted by 12.4 percentage points yr/yr to 45.9%, missing its forecast of 46.5%. It seems that analysts became a bit too dreary with their EPS estimates, but it's hard to blame them. INTC is coming off a dismal Q2 report in which it badly missed EPS projections, and the news since then has only darkened. In the weeks leading up to the chip maker's report, semiconductor companies such as <strong>Advanced Micro</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>), <strong>Micron</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>), and <strong>Applied Materials</strong> (<strong>AMAT</strong>) each severely cut their guidance.<br class="ContentPasted0" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;"><br class="ContentPasted0" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;">Outside of hurdling this low earnings bar, INTC's results and outlook were weak once again. Its Q4 guidance for EPS of $0.20 fell well short of expectations, while the mid-point of its $14-$15 bln revenue forecast indicates that top line growth will tumble further to -26%. However, shares are still rallying despite these negatives because INTC said the two magic words: cost cutting.<br class="ContentPasted0" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;"><br>Specifically, the company is targeting $3 bln in cost savings in 2023, with the amount increasing to $8-$10 bln annually by the end of 2025. That is an aggressive cost-cutting approach that will include a significant workforce reduction plan, a decrease in factory hours, and the delay of certain equipment purchases. Based on the magnitude of these cost cuts, it's clear that CEO Pat Gelsinger isn't anticipating conditions to improve any time soon. What has pleased investors, though, is that he's protecting the bottom line during this downturn and is positioning the company for rapid margin and earnings expansion once the cycle does turn higher again.<br><br class="ContentPasted0" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;">For now, it remains a rough picture for INTC's largest segments.</p><ul><li>The PC-centric Client Computing Group (CCG) experienced a 7% yr/yr drop in revenue to $8.1 bln as OEMs continued to reduce inventory levels. Demand for PCs and laptops has eroded in the face of inflation, rising rates, and the removal of the work-from-home catalyst. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments fell by 15% in the third quarter.</li><li>Customer inventory reductions are also afflicting the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) but rising competition from AMD in particular is also pressuring this segment. Revenue dove by 27% to $4.2 bln and operating income plunged from $2.3 bln in 3Q21 to essentially flat in 3Q22. DCAI was facing more difficult yr/yr comps than CCG as revenue and operating income grew by 10% and 8%, respectively, in the year-earlier period.</li></ul><p>INTC's surprise EPS beat was a welcomed change from last quarter's big miss, although it mostly reflects just how bearish analysts have become in recent weeks. Overall, this was another turbulent quarter for INTC and there are more tough quarters on the horizon, too. That is well understood and has been baked into the stock, which is why shares are jumping higher on the cost-cutting news. Unlike <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>), which intends to ramp up expenses as it builds out the metaverse, INTC is looking to substantially cut costs as it expands its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
