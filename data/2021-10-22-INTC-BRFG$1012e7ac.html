<html><body><p><strong>Intel (INTC -11%)</strong> is not looking too chipper today after the company reported Q3 results/guidance last night. The results were a bit unusual because Intel reported a huge EPS beat for Q3 that was paired with light revenue. Meanwhile, the Q4 guidance was the opposite, featuring downside EPS guidance with roughly in-line revenue. Also, Intel provided some long-term margin guidance that has troubled investors. </p><ul><li>The Client Computing Group segment (CCG) saw revenue fall 2% yr/yr to $9.66 bln. Demand has been robust, but Intel was lapping a challenging compare from the prior-year period, when lots of PCs were purchased as people shifted to at-home work. Also, component shortages are restricting low-end system sales. Intel notes that it is ramping down its Apple CPU and modem businesses. CCG revenue would have been up 10% otherwise. </li><li> <strong>PC demand remains very strong</strong>, experiencing particular strength in commercial, desktop, and higher-end consumer notebooks categories. Intel says PCs are now a "structurally larger and sustainably growing" market. Intel expects that the supply situation will gradually improve heading into 2022 and that the PC market will continue to grow amid tailwinds from Win 11 and increased hybrid work. Also, PC density is increasing (family members want their own computers) while replacement cycles are shortening. </li><li>The Data Center Group (DCG) segment grew revenue by 10% yr/yr to $6.50 bln, a nice bounce back from a decline in Q2. Intel is seeing a recovery in its enterprise and government segment and the Ice Lake ramp. Despite the decent growth, this segment came in below expectations due to component supply constraints impacting enterprise customers. Also, China was weak as customers adapted to new regulations. </li><li><strong>The guidance was the main trouble spot for sure.</strong> Revenue guidance for Q4 and 2022 were both good. However, the gross margin guidance was a concern. Intel expects gross margins of just 51-53% over the next 2-3 years before moving upward. Currently, gross margin is in the 56% area, so this guidance signals big a step down. Intel unveiled a significant ramp up in its foundry investment, which is pressuring margins. </li></ul><p> <strong>Bottom line, demand is not a problem.</strong> Because there are component shortages, the limited supply is going into higher-end PCs, and that is a big reason why Intel was able to beat handily on EPS even though revs were light. <strong>We view the stock's drop today as mostly a reaction to the company's significant ramp up in planned cap-ex spending, which is pressuring margin guidance. </strong>Other factors include the DCG segment showing weakness (<strong>AMD </strong>competitive concerns are a constant threat, and this result likely fuels concern) and Intel pushing back its Analyst Day to February 17 from November 18. </p><p>The lower margin guidance is really spooking investors and explains why Q4 EPS guidance came in light even as revenue guidance was in-line. Part of the concern is also the duration of the lowered guidance - 2-3 years is a long time. We suspect that analysts will be lowering EPS estimates for the next few years. We are still a little surprised that earlier this year Intel decided to double down on being a chip manufacturer; we thought that pursuing a fabless-focused route and farming out production to third parties could have been a more promising path. The hope is that the short-term pain is worth the long-term gain.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
