<html><body><p>Before the open tomorrow, <strong>PepsiCo</strong> (<strong>PEP</strong>) is scheduled to report Q3 earnings with a conference call following at 8:15 a.m E.T. &nbsp;For the quarter, analysts are expecting PEP to report EPS and revenue of $1.49 and $17.2 bln, respectively.<br><br>The company's recent performance versus quarterly expectations is solid.&nbsp;Over the past six quarters, PEP has met or exceeded the top and bottom-line consensus estimates each time.<br><br>Despite the string of better-than-expected results, the stock's performance has been underwhelming with shares essentially flat year-to-date. However, PEP has fared better than rival <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> (<strong>KO</strong>), which is down about 11% on the year.</p><p>While both PEP and KO have been hit by the virus, PEP has a few advantages in its corner.</p><ul><li>PEP has a strong snack business which has helped insulate the company from restaurant and entertainment venue closures. <ul><li>Last quarter, the Frito-Lay business (~27% of Q2 revenue) generated organic revenue growth of 6% compared to a 7% drop for the&nbsp;PepsiCo Beverages segment.</li><li>CEO Ramon Laguarta also noted that the company gained market share in the snack food business last quarter.</li></ul></li><li>The company's Quaker Foods unit (~5% of Q2 revenue)&nbsp;has benefited from the work-from-shift as more people eat breakfast at home.&nbsp;<ul><li>Organic revenue growth jumped by 23% in Q2 as brands like&nbsp;Quaker Oatmeal, Life, and the recently-retired syrup brand name Aunt Jemima are drawing more demand.</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;PEP's away-from-home channel is relatively light at 10-20% of its total business, compared to about 50% for KO. This favorable mix for PEP has helped offset headwinds related to business closures.</li></ul><p>In Q1, the company removed its FY20 guidance, citing uncertainties related to the virus. While PEP continued its practice of not providing EPS or revenue guidance last quarter, it did reaffirm its intention to return $7.5 bln in capital to shareholders this fiscal year.</p><p>The key question facing PEP is whether the momentum it has gained from the eat-at-home trend will continue as buying habits normalize and as businesses reopen. In Q1, Mr. Laguarta cautioned that sales in the&nbsp;retail channel were likely to soften going forward. However, based on&nbsp;PEP's Q2 results, it appears that the eat-at-home and food stockpiling trends have more lasting power than originally expected.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
