<html><body>Heading into <strong>Facebook's </strong>(<strong>FB</strong>) 3Q21 earnings report, a dizzying number of considerations swirled around its potential results, guidance, and the consequential stock reaction. At the top of the list was how <strong>Apple's </strong>(<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS 14 update and the addition of its App Transparency Tracking tool stymied <strong>Snap's</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) top-line performance and outlook, creating a red flag for FB's report. Casting additional apprehension has been the onslaught of negative stories in the press emanating from various whistleblowers. Given that FB already faces intense competitive pressures from SNAP and TikTok, the whistleblowers' testimonies regarding FB's alleged lack of concern about safety and security prompted speculation that FB could begin shedding a higher number of users.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">These issues, along with the ever-present antitrust and regulatory threats hanging over FB, are competing in a tug-of-war against the company's EPS beat, a new $50 bln stock repurchase program, and excitement regarding its investments in the metaverse.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">A $0.04 EPS beat may not seem like cause for celebration, especially since FB missed on the top line. The magnitude of the beat also pales in comparison to the upside seen in FB's previous five quarters, which included beats ranging from $0.42-0.98. Considering how far expectations had fallen, though, as reflected in the stock's 15% dive since early September, there's a sense of relief that FB's results weren't worse. Similarly, investors may be sensing that the worst effects of the iOS changes will be in the rearview mirror once the calendar flips to 2022.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">FB's guidance for Q4 was indeed soft, with the company forecasting revenue of $31.5-34.0 bln vs. the $34.8 bln consensus estimate. Headwinds from the iOS changes are expected to persist, but macroeconomic uncertainties (supply chain woes, shortages, inflation) were also cited, suggesting that FB anticipates a possible slowdown in ad spending this holiday season.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Although the near-term outlook remains a bit bleak, FB expressed its confidence in its long-term opportunities through the massive share buyback program. The company's bullish viewpoint hinges on its buildout and investments in the metaverse, a digital reality environment that CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes holds the future of communication. This commitment to the metaverse was on display during last night's earnings conference call when Zuckerberg announced that FB will begin breaking out financial results for Facebook Reality Labs next quarter.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Currently, Facebook Reality Labs includes Oculus virtual reality (VR) products. To expand its VR product lines and to establish a clear leadership position in the metaverse, FB intends to invest aggressively in the technology this year, causing a $10 bln reduction in operating profit. By building out this metaverse opportunity, FB not only hopes to capture an enduring growth driver, but it also strives to lessen its dependence on third party technology partners such as AAPL.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">There are many pieces to the FB puzzle at the moment, and investors are having a tough time putting them all together. In our view, the stock is likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future as the company navigates through a mine field of challenges and uncertainties while executing a major transition towards a metaverse-based future. Longer-term, we can envision FB emerging as a pioneer and leader in this metaverse technology, but it will take some time to complete that journey.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
