<html><body>After&nbsp;the close tonight,<strong> Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) is slated to issue 4Q20 results and is expected to issue guidance for 1Q21 and FY21. As a semiconductor bellwether, INTC's quarterly report is always a highly-anticipated event that draws major interest. This time, however, the company's report will face additional scrutiny for a couple different reasons.&nbsp;<br><br>The actual Q4 numbers shouldn't provide much of a surprise, however, because INTC issued updated guidance on January 13. Specifically, the company said it expects EPS to be greater than $1.10 vs. its prior outlook of $1.10. Similarly, INTC guided for revenue of more than $17.4 bln compared to its original forecast of approximately $17.4 bln.<br><br>Rather, the intrigue will center on the recent CEO shake-up, updates on its manufacturing troubles, and its outlook for the year.<br><br>When INTC issued guidance last week, it also announced that it named former <strong>VMware</strong> (<strong>VMW</strong>) CEO Pat Gelsinger as its new CEO, effective February 15. The change at the top didn't come as a shock given INTC's struggles over the past year. <br><br>While FY20 was a banner year for the semiconductor industry overall, as illustrated by the ~52% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, INTC stumbled as manufacturing issues and market share losses plagued the company.&nbsp;<br><br>The choice of Gelsinger has been widely applauded, though, causing sentiment to considerably brighten. Shares of INTC are now up 18% year-to-date, illustrating this new-found optimism.<br><br>What's particularly appealing about Gelsinger is that his background and expertise seem to be a good match for the problems that ail INTC. The company has lost much of its technological edge to competitors such as <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) and <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>). Traditionally known for manufacturing its own chips, INTC also suffered a huge setback last July after disclosing a manufacturing delay for its next generation 7-nanometer technology.<br><br>Gelsinger, who spent 30 years at INTC before taking the COO position at EMC in 2009, seems well-suited to put INTC's semiconductor development and manufacturing on a better path. As INTC's first Chief Technology Officer, who also accumulated a strong background in software and cloud computing, he may have the right toolkit to engineer a turnaround.<br><br>This recovery, which will be impacted by the decision to keep production in-house or to outsource production to a company like <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</strong> (<strong>TSM</strong>), will take several quarters to play out. These manufacturing variables could also make it difficult for INTC to provide an accurate FY21 forecast. As it currently stands, analysts are projecting the company to generate EPS and revenue of $4.55 and $71.2 bln in FY21.<br><br>With nearly a month of 1Q21 in the books, INTC should feel more comfortable with its quarterly guidance. Bullish data points for the semiconductor space emerged over the past few weeks, including strong Q1 guidance from <strong>Micron</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>) and <strong>STMicroelectronics</strong> (<strong>STM</strong>) on January 8. Strong demand for chips used in 5G-enabled mobile phones, data centers, and PCs, due to the work-from-home transition, continue to buoy the industry.<br><br>These favorable trends should help INTC meet or exceed the Q1 estimates of EPS of $0.96 and revenue of $16.35 bln. A upbeat Q1 outlook, coupled with a concrete plan to solve its manufacturing woes, should ease concerns about further market share losses, translating into further upside momentum.&nbsp;<br><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
