<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX)</strong> is set to report Q1 results today on its website right at the close with a video call to follow at 6pm ET. Current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus is for EPS to grow 90% yr/yr to $2.99 and for revenue to grow 24% yr/yr to $7.14 bln. In January, NFLX guided to EPS of $2.97 and revenue of $7.129 bln. NFLX also guided to Q1 global streaming net adds of +6.00 mln. </p><ul><li><strong>The most important operating metric with NFLX is global streaming net adds.</strong> After missing prior guidance in Q3 and with NFLX raising prices in Q4, we were not quite sure what to expect in Q4. Our concerns were a bit overblown with Q4 net adds coming in at a robust +8.51 mln vs prior guidance of +6.00 mln. That was up sharply from +2.20 mln in Q3. </li><li> <strong>However, the Q1 guidance was seen as perhaps a bit light at +6.00 mln.</strong> Q1 tends to be a sequentially higher quarter than Q4, so the sequential decline raised some eyebrows. However, we think it was still pretty good guidance when you dig into it. Recall that 1Q21 is lapping a massive +15.77 mln net add number in 1Q20 when the pandemic started and consumers streamed tv in a big way. That was NFLX's largest net add quarter for 2020, so +6.00 mln is a good number especially given the tough comparison and the price increase. </li><li> <strong>In terms of other important metrics, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU got back on track in Q4</strong> at $13.40 in Q3 vs $13.08 a year ago and vs $13.25 in Q2. ARPU had taken a dip in Q2 due to a heavy dose of free trials, but it was good to see that metric growing again. NFLX does not guide for ARPU, but we hope it keeps trending higher. </li><li><strong>Operating margin is another metric to watch.</strong> NFLX is guiding for a big jump in 1Q21 to 25.0% from 16.6% in 1Q20. Net adds grab most of the headlines, but we think investors should pay more attention to this sizeable expansion in margins. It shows how Netflix's greater scale is being leveraged on the bottom line. For all of 2020, operating margin was 18% vs 13% in 2019. For 2021, Netflix is now targeting 20%. </li><li><strong>Finally, we find the stock action a bit surprising. </strong>The stock has been basically trading sideways in the $475-575 area since July 2020, even as other tech names have been soaring. That makes us a bit cautious that a lot of the good news is priced in already. It also shows investor trepidation as NFLX starts to lap the huge net adds reported during the pandemic. However, if the stock can break above this trading range, that would be a positive sign for a leg higher. (PVIEW)</li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
