<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX)</strong> is set to report Q3 results today after the close with a video call to follow at 6pm ET. Current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus is for EPS to grow 46% yr/yr to $2.14 and for revenue to grow 22% yr/yr to $6.38 bln. In July, NFLX guided to EPS of $2.09 and revenue of $6.33 bln.  </p><ul><li>NFLX typically beats analyst expectations. It had reported upside to EPS consensus for eight consecutive quarters, but NFLX missed in back-to-back quarters in Q1 and Q2. Especially in Q2 with a $0.24 miss and mixed guidance which caused a sell-off in the stock. All eyes will be on NFLX to see it can get back to reporting EPS upside. </li><li><strong>The most important metric with NFLX is global streaming net adds. </strong>Global streaming net adds in Q2 were 10.09 mln, nicely above prior guidance of 7.50 mln as more people staying at home boosted numbers.  <ul><li>However, NFLX guided to just 2.5 mln global streaming net adds in Q3 which was lower than expected. </li><li>NFLX said it saw significant pull-forward in new sub adds in 1H20 (26 mln paid net adds vs. prior year of 12 mln). </li><li>As a result, NFLX expects less yr/yr growth in 2H20. </li><li>NFLX also said growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of COVID-19 and social restrictions. </li><li>We'll see if NFLX is just being overly cautious. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Another metric to watch is ARPU.</strong> The jump in membership additions in 1H20 also affected ARPU for its UCAN (US &amp; Canada) region. After rising sequentially each quarter in 2019, it dipped to $13.09 in Q1 from $13.22 in Q4. But Q2's $13.25 was slightly back above that Q4 number, so that was a good sign. The hope is that the numerous free trials from 1H20 have now expired and are now generating revenue from these new accounts which will help ARPU. So that will be something to watch. </li><li><strong>On the content front</strong>, NFLX said last quarter that the company was slowly resuming productions in many parts of the world with Asia Pacific being the farthest along. A slowdown in new content later in 2020 and 2021 could hurt net add growth down the road, so we'll be watching to see to what extent production is back up and running. </li><li>Another issue is to see if NFLX comments on <strong>Walt Disney (DIS)</strong> recently announcing a strategic reorganization for its media and entertainment businesses to focus on streaming. We doubt NFLX is concerned, but just something we'll have our antennas up for.</li><li> Bottom line, the stock has been a monster, going from $300 in mid-March to $532 currently. The stock has been roughly trading sideways since that rough Q2 report in July as we think investors are taking a wait-and-see approach on its Q3 report.
