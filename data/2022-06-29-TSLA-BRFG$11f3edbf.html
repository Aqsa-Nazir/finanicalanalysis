<html><body>It's been a bumpy ride for <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) lately and the road ahead is a bit more precarious as the electric vehicle (EV) maker reduces its workforce again. Last night, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that the company is laying off about 200 employees in its San Mateo, CA office, following a recent round of job cuts in the software engineer and human resources departments. On June 3, CEO Elon Musk signaled that TSLA is considering a workforce reduction plan, after stating that he had a "super bad" feeling about the economy.<br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;"><br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;">Therefore, the layoffs aren't catching investors completely off-guard. What is surprising, though, is that the employees in San Mateo were paid hourly and worked on TSLA's autopilot driver-assistance system. Originally, Musk planned on cutting up to 10% of TSLA's salaried staff, while retaining, or adding, to hourly positions that are involved in production. Although the employees reportedly being laid off don't work on an assembly line, they played an important role in the development of TSLA's autopilot technology. Specifically, they were tasked with labeling a massive number of captured images, such as street signs, traffic lights, lanes, and hazards, that the Autopilot system relies upon.<br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;"><br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;">It's no secret that Autopilot has been a major source of controversy for TSLA. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has recently said that it's aware of 35 crashes that occurred while Autopilot was activated, prompting the agency to investigate the driver-assistance system. We're not aware of any link between the ongoing investigation and TSLA's plan to cut its Autopilot staff, but the timing is interesting. It's also worth noting that TSLA's data labeling employees in Buffalo, New York, appear to be safe from this round of layoffs.<br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;"><br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;">TSLA certainly isn't throwing in the towel on its autonomous driving aspirations. During the Q1 earnings conference call, Musk touted a robo-taxi vehicle that will be produced at the new Austin, TX plant. Robo-taxi, which doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals, is expected to reach volume production in 2024.<br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;"><br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;">With the macroeconomic outlook becoming murkier, and with TSLA sinking billions into new factories in Texas and Berlin, its primary near-term focus is on ramping up production to remain comfortably profitable. In his typical melodramatic fashion, Musk recently stated during an interview that the new plants in Texas and Berlin are "gigantic money furnaces" because current production is so low. Meanwhile, COVID-related lockdowns in China stifled production at the Shanghai facility for several weeks, although output has improved lately. The bottom line, though, is that Q2 deliveries are expected to decline on a qtr/qtr basis for the first time in over two years.<br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;"><br style="font-size: medium; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Times;">In isolation, a reduction of 200 positions for a company that has about 100,000 employees isn't a material event. However, the news adds to the view that TSLA's momentum is unraveling, even as demand for its EVs remains sturdy.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
