<html><body>When new <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) CEO Pat Gelsinger took the reins on February 15, the change at the top sparked an excitement around the company that had been lacking for quite some time. This reinvigoration mainly centered on Gelsinger's bold strategy to restore INTC's legacy of being a premier designer and manufacturer of semiconductors, as illustrated by his plans to spend $20 bln to construct two new factories in Arizona. Gelsinger may ultimately succeed in this mission, but following INTC's 1Q21 earnings report, it's clear that this transformation won't happen overnight and that the journey may be a bumpy ride.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With INTC comfortably exceeding analysts' Q1 expectations -- and its own upwardly revised guidance from March 23 -- the headline numbers for the quarter look very solid. Business is still booming in INTC's Client Computing Group (CCG), which continues to capitalize on the work-from-home shift that is fueling a surge in demand for PCs and notebooks. In fact, the company shipped more notebook CPUs in Q1 than in any other quarter in its history, while PC unit volumes jumped by a robust 38%. Impressively, INTC effectively mitigated the global component shortage by finishing production in its own factories, including the application of substrates, which have been in short supply.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another standout performer was Mobileye. The acceleration towards autonomous driving and a steady flow of design wins with automakers, including eight during Q1, helped drive a 48% jump in Mobileye revenue to $377 mln.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These positives, though, are being clouded by the ongoing struggles in INTC's Data Center Group (DCG). Following a 16% drop in DCG revenue last quarter, sales fell by an even steeper 20% in Q1, prompting concerns that INTC is losing market share to rivals like <strong>Advanced Micro</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>). Since chips designed for cloud computing networks carry higher average selling prices than those sold in the PC market, the decline in DCG sales is especially damaging. This issue is revealed in the sharp 6.1 percentage point drop in non-GAAP gross margin to 58.4%.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">According to Gelsinger, the primary cause for the decline in DCG sales is related to cloud computing customers wading through a "digestion period" after ramping up investments. There is certainly some validity to that assessment, as illustrated by the 34% spike in DCG revenue in the year-ago quarter. However, it's troubling to see the lack of improvement here, and it is well-known that other chip makers, including AMD, have been making a strong push into the data center space.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As INTC looks to get its DCG business back on track, it also plans to boost spending on 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer manufacturing technologies. Consequently, the company's Q2 EPS forecast of $1.05 came in below the $1.10 consensus estimate, while revenue of $17.8 bln was essentially in line with expectations.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The company did nudge its FY21 guidance slightly higher, projecting EPS of $4.60 compared to its prior outlook of $4.55, with a $500 mln increase in its revenue forecast to $72.5 bln. One possible red flag is that INTC expects gross margin to erode further to 56.5%, heightening concerns that the fierce competitive landscape is taking a toll.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Currently, there is a substantial contrast in performance among INTC's main segments. Although the PC and notebook market are on fire, it's fair to wonder when this boom will subside once the work-from-home trend fully plays out. That could still be a few quarters, or more, down the road, but it's worth noting that INTC will be lapping very difficult numbers in the CCG segment throughout the remainder of 2021. Therefore, if things don't quickly turn around in the DCG segment, the company's financial performance may continue to disappoint. Longer-term, we like INTC's decision to "go for it" by bringing production in-house, but there will undoubtedly be more speed bumps along the way.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
