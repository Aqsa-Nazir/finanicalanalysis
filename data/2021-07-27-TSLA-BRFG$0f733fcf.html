<html><body>In 2Q21, <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) overcame lingering semiconductor shortages to deliver exceptional results that featured record quarterly operating profit of $1.3 bln and a sharp increase in automotive gross margin to 28.4%. The company's improving production efficiency and cost optimization efforts were key factors behind the strong performance, leading to the sizable $0.47 EPS beat. Additionally, TSLA's ingenuity enabled it to mitigate the semiconductor shortages by substituting alternative chips and then rewriting the firmware to maintain production. Consequently, the company achieved record deliveries of 201,304 vehicles during the quarter.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However, TSLA is not completely immune to supply chain constraints. During the earnings conference call, CEO Elon Musk stated, "[W]hile we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain, which is the wide range of chips..."<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Therefore, the main question moving forward is whether TSLA can substantially meet rising consumer demand. On a related note, Musk also noted that consumer support and interest for electric vehicles (EVs) is reaching an inflection point. With momentum steadily building, the challenge will be to keep production running near full capacity in the face of these chip shortages.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another potential concern for investors is that vehicle ASPs continue to decline. In Q2, ASPs decreased by 2% yr/yr due to lower Model S and Model X deliveries and an unfavorable product mix as China-made vehicles became a larger portion of total sales. We're not overly concerned about the drop, though, because the company is aiming to improve affordability in order to drive volumes upward. In turn, the higher volume creates production efficiencies due to increased scale, pushing automotive gross margin higher.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">More worrisome is that TSLA is delaying the launch of its Semi truck program to 2022 and that it may also shift the launch of its highly-anticipated Cybertruck. Earlier this year, Musk said that initial deliveries of Tesla Semi would start later in 2021. In regards to Cybertruck, the pick-up will be built in TSLA's new Austin, TX facility, which is expected to produce vehicles this year. Since the newly designed Model Y crossover will take precedence in Austin, it's unclear exactly when Cybertrucks will begin rolling out of the plant, especially given the chip shortage situation.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Supply chain issues notwithstanding, the longer-term outlook for TSLA remains very bright. The company reiterated its forecast to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Along with burgeoning demand for EVs, TSLA's rapidly growing energy storage (+204% in MWh deployed) and solar (+215% in MW deployed) businesses provide additional catalysts. While the risks are also considerable, TSLA has proven that it can still execute in very challenging environments.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
