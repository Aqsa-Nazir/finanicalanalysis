<html><body><p>Good news has been hard to come by for <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>), which has been battered and bruised from eroding chip demand in the PC/laptop and data center markets, and from its pivotal decision to greatly expand production in the U.S. Today, though, a ray of light is brightening the gloomy backdrop for the stock in the form of an IPO filing.<br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">Specifically, Mobileye, INTC's autonomous driving business, filed its IPO prospectus with the SEC. The filing is a positive surprise because it indicates that a pricing could be just around the corner. Recall that in mid-September, Bloomberg reported that INTC may postpone the IPO until 2023 due to market conditions. A delay could still happen if market volatility worsens, but making the filing public (INTC filed confidentially on Sept. 12) represents a significant step forward in the process.<br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">For some quick background, INTC acquired Mobileye in 2017 for $15.0 bln, opening the door for INTC to become a major participant in the ADAS and autonomous driving movement. As a pioneer in these technologies, Mobileye has built a leading ADAS platform that relies on sensing, perception, and computer vision capabilities that are powered by its software and EyeQ SoCs. Over the years, it has established many key partnerships within the automotive industry -- including with more than fifty OEMs as of July 2, 2022 -- and its momentum continues to build.<br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">While some of INTC's strategic plans have garnered plenty of consternation, such as investing tens of billions into new manufacturing facilities, its acquisition of Mobileye has been an unambiguous success.</p><ul><li>The segment has consistently stood out, providing a bright spot in recent quarterly reports that have otherwise disappointed. Mobileye's revenue jumped by 41% to a record $460 mln in Q2, and the segment generated positive adjusted net income of $276 mln for the six months ended July 2, 2022.</li><li>Now, INTC is ready to cash in on its investment with reports suggesting that it's anticipating a $30 bln valuation for Mobileye. That forecast is down substantially from its initial estimate of $50+ bln, but it's possible that demand for the IPO could heat up as the pricing gets closer and as its growth potential is highlighted.<ul><li>The market opportunity for ADAS and autonomous driving is massive, with Mobileye expecting its total addressable market (TAM) to reach $480 bln over the long term. For context, the company estimates its current TAM to be about $16 bln.</li></ul></li><li>A higher projected Mobileye valuation would obviously be a catalyst for INTC shares. At this point, neither the expected price range, nor the number of shares offered, are known. Those specifics will be disclosed in an amended filing, which could come within the next couple of weeks.</li><li>INTC plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt, which totaled $32.5 bln as of July 2, 2022, and for working capital purposes. This will likely include investments for the construction of its new $20 bln factory in Ohio.</li></ul><p>If INTC can successfully launch the Mobileye IPO, it would not only be a major positive for the company, but it would also be an encouraging sign for the frozen IPO market. A few weeks ago, <strong>Corebridge Financial</strong> (<strong>CRBG</strong>), an offshoot of <strong>AIG</strong> (<strong>AIG</strong>), managed to go public without cutting the deal size. Although the IPO priced at the low end of expectations, we view its IPO as a step in the right direction. Given its strong growth, profitability, and positioning within the up-and-coming autonomous driving market, we believe that Mobileye has the potential to fully break through.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
