<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX -4%)</strong> is streaming lower today after reporting Q2 results last night. The report's headline numbers were not great, but the main reason for the weakness is likely the company's Q3 guidance for net sub adds. </p><ul><li><strong>Netflix reported a pretty sizable $0.19 EPS miss</strong> while revenue was in-line. We're not overly worried about the miss. Remember that a big driver of the company's profitability is related to how much Netflix spends on production costs, so it can be a hard metric to predict. After pausing much of its production activity due to the pandemic, NFLX's production work is now back up and running, albeit with COVID protocols. Also, unlike most companies that provide a range for EPS guidance, NFLX provides just one number, which may also make analysts' jobs more difficult when they create their models. </li><li><strong>Global streaming paid net adds are a bigger issue.</strong> Q2 came in at +1.54 mln - slightly better than the +1.00 mln prior guidance, but not stellar. Also, the APAC region represented about two-thirds of global paid net adds in the quarter. We would have preferred to see more US growth. </li><li> <strong>The guidance for net adds was probably the biggest stumbling point for us.</strong> NFLX was lapping tough pandemic-driven comps in Q1 and Q2 last year at 15.77 mln and 10.09 mln, respectively, so we sort of discounted weak comps in 1Q21 and 2Q21. However, in Q3, NFLX will lap an easy year-ago comp of just +2.20 mln, so we expected robust guidance for 3Q21. However, NFLX guided to just +3.5 mln, which is below Street estimates. The one saving grace on the call was NFLX saying it hopes that by Q4 it will get through the tail-end of COVID choppiness. NFLX expects to end the year on a more normalized growth trajectory. </li><li> <strong>In terms of other important metrics, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU </strong>keeps growing at $14.54 vs $14.25 in Q1 and vs $13.25 a year ago. NFLX rolled out a US price increase in Q4, and now we're seeing that effect roll into the ARPU metric. </li><li> Net sub adds get most of the attention, but <strong>we'd argue that operating margin should get more attention</strong>. In Q2, it came in at 25.2%, roughly in-line with 25.5% prior guidance. Perhaps a slight disappointment after a big beat in Q1, but again, NFLX is ramping up production, and that costs money. NFLX did reaffirm its target of 20% for the full year 2021 vs. 18% in 2020. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, the weak net add guidance for Q3 seems to be weighing on the stock, probably more so than the EPS miss.</strong> But do not overlook the ARPU and operating margin metrics; we think that's helping to counteract the impact the net add guidance on the stock price today. We continue to think investors should expect some net add choppiness in the coming quarters. Net adds were already a tough metric to predict, and the pandemic made predicting it even harder. As a result, the stock has been trading sideways all year, sort of in a holding pattern. However, if NFLX can resume normalized net add growth again in 2022, we think the stock could get moving again.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
