<html><body><p>Shares of <strong>PayPal (PYPL -2%)</strong>&nbsp;are trying to recoup their losses today after the payment processor delivered earnings and sales upside in Q3. Last quarter, PYPL received a nice push on a narrower earnings beat and downbeat Q3 sales guidance as investors applauded its $15 bln share repurchase program and were excited to hear that Elliott Investment Management took a $2.0 bln stake in the company. </p><p> This time around, without these exciting headlines, investors are focusing more on Q3 results, which continue to show some weaknesses, partially buoyed by a few encouraging signs.</p><ul><li>The item receiving much of the attention today is Q4 guidance. PYPL expects adjusted EPS of $1.18-1.20 and revs of approximately $7.375 bln, representing just 6.6% growth yr/yr, a further deceleration in revs from the +10.7% posted in Q3, and PYPL's softest quarter in over five years. </li><li>PYPL was excited to announce that it is working with <strong>Apple (AAPL) </strong>to allow U.S. merchants to accept Apple Pay using the PayPal or Venmo app. iPhone users can choose Apple Pay when checking out on PayPal or Venmo and add PayPal and Venmo credit and debit cards to Apple Wallet. It will also eliminate the need for merchants to use a dongle or other payment terminals, as their iPhones can be used as a mobile point of sale. <ul><li> Despite PYPL's excitement, we do not view this development as that significant, especially since competitors like <strong>Block (SQ)</strong> have had this feature for some time. </li><li> The same holds true regarding PYPL's recent partnership with <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>, whereby the e-commerce giant would offer Venmo as a new payment option for orders placed on its site. Although it helped spark a brief upswing for PYPL shares, we question how many AMZN users will stop using AMZN branded credit cards, which carry 5% back for Prime members, and switch to PYPL branded cards. </li></ul></li><li>On a lighter note, net new accounts (NNAs) were 2.9 mln in Q3, a solid acceleration from 0.4 mln in Q2 and 2.4 mln in Q1. PYPL expects further growth in Q4, estimating another 3-4 mln NNAs. </li><li>Total payment volume (TPV) also accelerated from the previous quarter, jumping 14% on an FX-neutral basis to $337.0 bln. With TPV growth slowly eroding lately, going from 24% in 3Q21 to 23% in 4Q21, 15% in 1Q22, and then 13% in 2Q22, it was encouraging to see the metric stabilize in Q3. </li><li>It is also worth noting that Q3 operating expenses grew just 4% yr/yr compared to 17% in the year-ago period, helping lift operating margins 2 pts above its prior outlook to 22.4%. PYPL also expects to expand operating margins for the first time this year in Q4, an encouraging sign that the investment by Elliot Investment Management, which tends to push for cost discipline, is bearing fruit. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, PYPL's Q3 report did not contain many exciting developments. However, there were still some bright spots in the quarter, giving credibility to a possible turnaround for the stock, which is down around 60% on the year. Competition remains fierce, with tech giants like AAPL, AMZN, and <strong>Alphabet (GOOG)</strong>, as well as buy now, pay later firms like <strong>Affirm (AFRM)</strong> and SQ, all competing for a slice of the payment processing pie. However, PYPL's attractive forward P/E ratio of ~17x, buyback program, and Elliot Investment Management's backing make it a possible turnaround play. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
