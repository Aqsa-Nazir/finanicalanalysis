<html><body><p><strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> is set to report Q3 earnings results today after the close with a call to follow at 5pm ET. Intel usually reports soon after the bell. The current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus calls for EPS to be flat yr/yr at $1.11 while revenue is also expected to be roughly flat at $18.27 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revs for the next quarter and full year. </p><ul><li><strong>Last quarter, results were a tale of two segments.</strong> The PC-centric segment (CCG) did well as revenue grew 6% yr/yr to $10.1 bln. Demand has been strong and the industry was back to shipping over 1 mln PC units a day despite component shortages. </li><li> <strong>Driving demand is increasing PC density in the home</strong>, more family members want their own computer. Also, many companies are opting for hybrid work models which often requires two computers. There is also replacement cycles, which are shortening on a larger and aging installed base. Also, global penetration rates are increasing as PCs become more affordable. Intel sees huge potential in areas like education as PCs per hundred students remains in the single digits. </li><li> <strong>Intel's other major segment is data center (DCG)</strong> and revenue in Q2 fell 9% yr/yr to $6.5 bln. The good news is that Intel expects momentum to increase through the year, achieving double-digit yr/yr growth in 2H21. So we will look for improvement here in today's Q3 report. </li><li><strong>An overarching theme will be how supply chain issues are affecting Intel.</strong> The strong demand environment has been stressing the supply chain. On its Q2 call in July, Intel said it expects the shortages to bottom out in 2H21, however, the not so good news is that it may take another 1-2 years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand. We will be listening closely for any change to this outlook. </li><li><strong>A potential issue to keep on your radar</strong> is the fact that Intel is really ramping up its production capacity with major fab construction projects underway in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland, and Israel. While it's good that Intel is ramping capacity during a chip shortage, this will take time and money and impact margins. </li><li> <strong>In terms of what to expect, Intel has been reporting strong upside in recent quarters</strong>, with EPS beats ranging from $0.21-0.41 over the past three quarters. However, the stock reaction has not necessarily correlated to the upside. Investor interest goes beyond the numbers. They tend to be just as interested in Intel's general commentary and last quarter's long term outlook weighed on the stock. </li><li>Finally, Intel is a chip giant of course, and its results/commentary will have implications for the broader semiconductor space. <strong>AMD </strong>is a close rival, it reports on Tuesday, October 26 after the close.</li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
