<html><body>Spin-offs have been in vogue recently as companies look to unlock value from higher growth business units while reorganizing into simpler and more streamlined corporate structures. This morning, <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) announced that it will join the ranks of <strong>Dell </strong>(<strong>DELL</strong>), <strong>General Electric</strong> (<strong>GE</strong>), <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> (<strong>JNJ</strong>), and <strong>Honeywell</strong> (<strong>HON</strong>) as leading companies that opted to split off a top-performing segment this year. Specifically, the semiconductor behemoth, which is already navigating through a major transition as it expands its in-house production capabilities, plans to spin-off its Mobileye unit through an IPO in mid-2022. The proposed deal could rake in $50 bln or more in proceeds, providing INTC with a war chest of capital to invest in new foundries and technologies to advance its data center, graphics, and networking chips. <br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">This development comes as welcome news for INTC investors, who have seen shares slide by 25% since this past spring. Recall that in late March, newly-minted CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that INTC would invest $20 bln to build two new factories in Arizona. While most semiconductor companies outsource manufacturing to third party foundries, INTC is boldly heading in the opposite direction, looking to challenge <strong>Taiwan Semi's </strong>(<strong>TSM</strong>) top spot in the chip making industry. After the initial excitement about INTC's ambitions faded, reality set in over the past several months as INTC issued disappointing quarterly results and guidance. For instance, in Q3, the company provided downside Q4 EPS guidance and stated that its gross margin will be below current levels (55-56%) for the next two to three years. A primary cause for the anticipated margin erosion is related to its new facility investments.<br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The understanding that a long, difficult path lays ahead for INTC cast an overhang on the stock, but for the company to cash in on its valuable Mobileye segment could turbo-charge INTC's in-house manufacturing strategy. At the same time, the company would still capitalize on Mobileye's success and growth since INTC plans to remain the majority owner after the IPO. Although supply chain disruptions and component shortages have battered INTC's Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center Group (DCG), Mobileye has continued to post impressive results. In Q3, CCG revenue fell by 2% and DCG revenue grew by a mediocre 10%, while Mobileye's top-line jumped by 39% to $326 mln. <br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Like semiconductor peers <strong>Qualcomm</strong> (<strong>QCOM</strong>), <strong>Marvell</strong> (<strong>MRVL</strong>), and <strong>Texas Instruments</strong> (<strong>TXN</strong>), Mobileye is experiencing robust demand from auto OEMs due to the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving technology, and the electrification of vehicles. As a provider of chips that work in tandem with vehicle sensors and cameras, Mobileye is in the sweet spot of potent auto industry trends. This is reflected in the fact that Mobileye has secured contract wins with over 30 automakers, putting it on pace to generate revenue growth of 40% for the year.<br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Moving forward, INTC will continue to work with Mobileye, developing new chips and technologies for the auto market. That's good news because INTC has only scratched the surface in terms of its revenue opportunity in the auto industry. By the end of the decade, the market for automotive silicon may reach $115 bln, according to INTC, as an increasing number of chips are embedded into vehicles. On that note, the company estimates that the share of semiconductors will be ~20% of a premium vehicle's total bill-of-materials by 2030.<br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br aria-hidden="true" style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">It's easy to understand the enthusiasm regarding the proposed spin-off of Mobileye. It seems like a win-win scenario for INTC, allowing the company to still reap the rewards of Mobileye's growth while also providing it with an infusion of cash to fortify its chip manufacturing infrastructure.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
