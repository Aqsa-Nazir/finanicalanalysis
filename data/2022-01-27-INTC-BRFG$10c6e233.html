<html><body><p><strong>Intel (INTC 48.64, -3.05, -6%)</strong> is not looking too chipper today. The stock is down big after the company reported Q4 results/guidance last night. The results for Q4 featured nice upside for EPS, revenues, and gross margin. Also, Intel announced a 5% dividend increase. However, the company's Q1 guidance was more mixed (revenue upside, EPS downside), and its commentary about the duration of supply chain issues is weighing on the stock as well. </p><p> <strong>Before digging into the quarter, we should note that Intel dropped a bit of a bombshell in October</strong> when it announced that it expects non-GAAP gross margins to reach levels of just 51-53% over the next 2-3 years before moving upward. Intel unveiled a significant ramp in its foundry investment that is pressuring margins. In light of that forecast, we intend to keep a close eye on gross margins through coming quarters. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin fell to 55.4% from 60.0% a year ago but was, on a positive note, above prior guidance of 53.5%. However, Intel is guiding for a sequential decline in Q1 at 52%. </p><ul><li>The strong demand seen throughout 2021 continued in Q4 as markets remained robust across Intel's businesses. This momentum is expected to continue, driven by the "digitization of everything" trend. Also, Intel noted that 2021 marked the best year in a decade for the PC industry. Third parties reported ~15% growth, driven by higher PC density, shorter replacement cycles, and increased market penetration. The recent Windows 11 launch also helped. </li><li>Despite robust PC demand, especially on the commercial side, revenue from Intel's Client Computing Group segment (CCG) fell 7% yr/yr to $10.13 bln. However, that revenue was up 5% sequentially, and Intel was lapping a challenging compare from the prior year, when lots of PCs were purchased as people shifted to at-home work. </li><li>Its Data Center Group (DCG) segment delivered a record $7.3 bln in revenue, up 12% sequentially and up 20% yr/yr. The data center market was led by the enterprise vertical, where the market continues to recover from COVID lows. Intel expects the data center, network, and edge markets to continue to have robust growth as hyperscalers lay out multiyear cloud CapEx investment plans. </li><li> Unfortunately, Intel was more pessimistic regarding supply constraint issues. Shortages in substrates, components, and foundry silicon have limited Intel's customers' ability to ship finished system, especially in the client market and particularly in notebooks. However, constraints are also impacting spaces like automotive, IoT, and data center. </li></ul><p> <strong>Bottom line, demand remains robust, but supply constraints,</strong> not just at Intel but also at its customers, remain a headwind. Notably, during its Q3 call in October, Intel said that it expected the supply situation to "gradually improve" heading into 2022, but now Intel expects ecosystem constraints to persist through 2022 and into 2023 with incremental improvements over this period. <strong>We think these comments are even more responsible than the Q1 EPS guidance downside for the big drop in the stock today</strong>.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
