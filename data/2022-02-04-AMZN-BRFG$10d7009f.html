<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN 3098.42, +321.51, +11.6%)</strong> is making a Prime move following its Q4 report. After missing on EPS pretty badly in Q3, Q4 was a nice bounce back quarter for Amazon. The areas that jump out at us are the AWS and Advertising Services segments, both of which posted big results. The company also announced the boost of a price increase for its Prime memberships. </p><p>At first glance, the report does not look like it would warrant such a huge move in the stock as today's action has delivered. Revenue was basically in-line, and we did not get an adjusted EPS result, so we do not really know the clean earnings number, as the GAAP result factored in a huge non-cash benefit. We probably can infer it was a beat because operating income came in ahead of prior guidance, but we cannot be sure. AMZN also guided Q1 revs below consensus. </p><p><strong>So why is the stock trading so much higher?</strong> </p><ul><li><strong>A big number from its AWS segment looks like a main reason.</strong> Its +39.5% growth was a modest acceleration from +39% growth in Q3, +37% growth in Q2, +32% in Q1, and +28% in 4Q20. Remember that <strong>Microsoft (MSFT) </strong>saw Azure revenue growth dip to +46% in DecQ when it reported last week, which was a decent decline from marks of around +50% the past few quarters. Maybe AWS is taking share; either way, its result was impressive. </li><li> <strong>As we said, we do not have a clean adjusted EPS number</strong> from AMZN, but the Q4 operating income number at $3.46 bln was above the high end of prior guidance of $0-3 bln and above consensus of $2.57 bln. That is a decent proxy for profitability, and we can probably infer an upside EPS result. Also, AMZN guided to a sequential increase in Q1 operating income at the mid-point at $3-6 bln. However, that was below consensus of $6.35 bln. </li><li><strong>AMZN stressed last quarter that inflation</strong>, especially higher wages and higher pricing from third party carriers, would take a bite out of Q4. Prior guidance for inflation was that it would have a $4 bln impact in Q4, and AMZN said on the call that its actual impact came in above that. AMZN expects these cost challenges to persist into Q1, albeit adjusted for lower seasonal volumes relative to Q4. We think investors are happy that the inflation impact was not even worse. </li><li><strong>We think investors love the Prime subscription price increase,</strong> as it signals that management is confident in its business. The increase is decently substantial, and they know their subscribers will pay it. This was Prime's first price hike since 2018, so we do not expect much pushback from consumers. </li><li><strong>For the first time, AMZN has started breaking out Advertising Services </strong>revenue. It rose 32% yr/yr to $9.72 bln, a robust result that lets investors breathe a little easier after <strong>Meta Platforms (FB)</strong> sold off yesterday in connection with slowing ad growth, which FB attributed to Apple's new privacy rules. The other aspect to this is that at nearly $10 bln, it is a larger business than we and many investors had thought it was.</li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
