<html><body><p>Since the pandemic began rippling across the country in March, <strong>PepsiCo's</strong> (<strong>PEP</strong>) Frito-Lay snack business has experienced an acceleration in growth as people transitioned to working at home. However, the pandemic has had the opposite effect on PEP's core North America beverage segment. Restaurant, theater, office, and entertainment venue closures have pressured volumes in the category.<br><br>Following the measured reopening of businesses, and with many employees remaining at home, PEP is now in a sweet spot. As the company's strong Q3 results demonstrate, each of PEP's segments are now performing well.</p><ul><li>EPS grew 6% yr/yr to $1.66, comfortably exceeding the $1.49 consensus estimate. In fact, the $0.17 beat is the company's largest beat in over five years.<ul><li>The bottom-line outperformance was driven by healthy organic revenue growth of 4.2%, representing a significant improvement from the -0.3% mark last quarter.</li></ul></li><li>The turnaround in PepsiCo Beverages North America (33% of revenue) is the main highlight from PEP's earnings report. After sliding by 7% in Q2, the unit posted organic revenue growth of 3% this quarter. <ul><li>During this morning's earnings conference call, CEO Ramon Laguarta stated that large format channels and convenience gas stations delivered strong growth. Additionally, sales declines moderated in the battered foodservice channel as economies began to reopen.</li><li>PEP also believes that it gained market share in the coffee, tea, and juices categories.</li></ul></li><li>Frito-Lay (24% of revenue) continued its solid performance, generating organic revenue growth of 6%, matching last quarter's increase. The steady growth is encouraging, indicating that there may be some stickiness in demand as conditions normalize.<ul><li>Like the beverage segment, PEP believes it gained share in the macro-snack category, with Tostitos delivering double-digit growth, Cheetos posting high-single-digit growth, and Doritos and Ruffles generating mid-single-digit growth.</li></ul></li><li>The one minor disappointment is that organic revenue growth in the Quaker Foods unit tapered off to 6% from 23% last quarter. At just 3% of total sales, Quaker is by far PEP's smallest segment, so the sharp decline isn't overly impactful.<ul><li>Regarding the deceleration in growth, Mr. Laguarta said that Quaker's growth was in line with what the company was expecting and consistent with where the business was trending after economies began to reopen in Q2.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Beyond the impressive quarterly results, the other main story is that PEP reinstated its guidance after withholding guidance in Q1 and Q2. The company is forecasting FY20 EPS of $5.50, ahead of the $5.37 consensus estimate.</p><p>The issue, though, is that PEP's FY20 EPS guidance indicates that company is expecting Q4 EPS of $1.45, which is slightly below the $1.49 expectation. PEP's forecast of FY20 organic revenue growth of 4.0% is also only modestly ahead of the 3.6% year-to-date growth.</p><p>Perhaps the company is taking a conservative approach with its guidance, but it's also possible that PEP is anticipating growth to moderate in the Frito-Lay business as the eat-at-home catalyst loses some momentum. Even if that is the case, PEP is in a good position to post strong results due to market share gains and to the likelihood that many employees will remain at home for the foreseeable future, or perhaps permanently.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
