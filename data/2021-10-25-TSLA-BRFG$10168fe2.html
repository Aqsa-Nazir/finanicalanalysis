<html><body>Fresh off last week's impressive earnings report, <strong>Tesla </strong>(<strong>TSLA</strong>) is charging to all-time highs as a series of bullish developments electrify the stock. Most notably, rental car company <strong>Hertz Global</strong> (<strong>HTZZ</strong>), which just emerged from bankruptcy in June, announced plans to purchase 100,000 Tesla Model 3s by the end of next year. The order, estimated to be worth more than $4 bln, amplifies a robust consumer demand environment, as illustrated by the 73% surge in vehicle deliveries in Q3.<br><br>Adding to the positive vibe, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas boosted his TSLA price target to $1,200 from $900, noting that the firm's previous forecast of 5.8 mln vehicle deliveries by 2030 looks too low. Now, Jonas is forecasting 8.1 mln vehicle deliveries by 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 28%.<br><br>This rising production volume is being coupled with higher prices. According to <em>Reuters</em>, TSLA recently hiked prices by $5,000 for variants of its Model X and S cars, underscoring the resilient demand for its electric vehicles (EVs). The pricing maneuver not only helps to mitigate soaring raw material costs, but it also eases concern that intensifying competitive pressures are weighing on average selling prices (ASPs). Recall that in Q3, ASPs fell by 6%, following a 3% dip in Q2. Improving manufacturing efficiency has allowed TSLA to expand its automotive gross margin despite declining ASPs. With TSLA CFO Zack Kirkhorn forecasting automotive gross margin to slide once the new factories in Texas and Germany open, the price increase could help to offset those anticipated margin headwinds.<br><br>The opening of those new plants couldn't come at a better time as TSLA looks to fulfill this record-setting order from HTZZ. There are already immense strains on the company's production capabilities. Kirkhorn stated during the Q3 earnings conference call that order backlogs are continuing to grow and that average customer wait times are extending. While TSLA has navigated around the chip shortages much better than most auto makers, it hasn't been totally immune. In Q3, TSLA's factories were not operating at full capacity due to shortages. Adding to the degree of difficulty is that TSLA's new Austin plant is preparing for two major launches in the coming months: first, a new version of the Model Y, followed by Cybertruck later in 2022.<br><br>Considering the persistent disruptions in the global supply chain and given that the HTZZ order represents ~10% of TSLA's current annual production capacity, there could be some bumps in the road as this deal plays out. It's also worth pointing out that this isn't an exclusive arrangement with HTZZ. Other auto manufacturers such as <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>) and <strong>Ford</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) could enter the mix later as HTZZ executes its mission to electrify nearly all of its fleet.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, though, the deal with HTZZ is a huge win for TSLA on several levels. Beyond the windfall from the order itself, the availability of 100,000 new Model 3s on HTZZ's lots is like a direct marketing campaign for TSLA. After being introduced to TSLA for the first time, some of those HTZZ customers may ultimately turn into TSLA customers.&nbsp;Additionally, the deal represents another milestone in the broader adoption of EVs, while also opening up an entirely new market for TSLA.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
