<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX -8%)</strong> is not wearing The Crown today. The streaming giant is trading sharply lower after reporting Q1 results last night. The quarter's headline numbers were decent; revenue was in-line with analyst expectations. NFLX also guided Q2 EPS well above consensus, although Q2's revenue guidance was a bit light. </p><ul><li>However, the EPS and revenue numbers are not the main story today. The company's most important operating metric is global streaming net adds. In recent quarters, NFLX's additions have been all over the place. After missing prior guidance in Q3, NFLX rebounded with strong sub net add upside in Q4. However, Q1 came in at just +3.98 mln vs prior guidance of +6.00 mln, and Q2 guidance at just +1.00 mln was pretty paltry. </li><li>In Netflix's defense, the company is lapping massive net sub adds from this time last year, when the pandemic was just getting underway. Not only are the year-ago comps high, but they also contributed a pull-forward effect in 2020. </li><li>During the same period, there was a near global shutdown in content production. As a result, some key title launches initially set for 1H21 were pushed back into 2H21. NFLX insists that the slowdown was not caused by competing streaming services. Competition has always been high. </li><li>In terms of other important metrics, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU keeps growing at $14.25 in Q1, up sharply from $13.51 in Q4 and $13.40 in Q3. NFLX rolled out a US price increase in Q4, and we're now seeing that roll into the ARPU metric. </li><li> Operating margin was another bright spot at a record 27.4% in Q1 vs 25.0% prior guidance and vs 16.6% a year ago. NFLX also guided to Q2 operating margin of 25.5% vs 21.8% consensus. Net adds are what everyone focuses on, but this margin expansion merits recognition as well. This shows the benefit of price increases and higher revs, while at the same time production costs are being reduced. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, the net add miss in Q1 and weak guidance for Q2 are dragging the stock lower today, crowding out good metrics </strong>like ARPU and operating margin and NFLX's announcement of a $5 bln share buyback program. We think investors should expect some net add choppiness in the coming quarters. Net adds were already a tough metric to predict, and the pandemic has made such forecasting harder. Our fear is that NFLX may decide to stop providing net add guidance in light of the wild swings it causes in the stock price. </p><p> <strong>The nugget of good news is that this paltry Q2 net add guidance seems sufficiently low that NFLX could easily outperform in Q2. </strong>For one thing, it's lapping an easier year ago comp in Q2 (+10.09 mln) than it did in Q1 (+15.77 mln), and +1.00 mln guidance seems like a low bar. If NFLX shares remain weak heading into the company's Q2 report, it's something to keep in mind.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
