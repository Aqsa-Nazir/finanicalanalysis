<html><body><p><strong>Adobe (ADBE -3%) </strong>looks to be stuck in the mud today despite reporting a top-and bottom-line beat for Q3 (Aug). Although ADBE also posted revenue growth of over 20% for the third consecutive quarter, its $0.09 EPS beat was not as robust as the double-digit beats it achieved over the previous five quarters or the $0.21 beat last quarter. Furthermore, the stock has appreciated over 17% since ADBE's Q2 (May) earnings report in mid-June, so some profit-taking could be in play today as well. </p><p>Nonetheless, ADBE still showed that it is a leader in the digital transformation happening across nearly every industry, as evidenced by several Q3 highlights. </p><ul><li>ADBE delivered revenue growth of 22% yr/yr to $3.94 bln, topping consensus. Aside from FY20, in which ADBE grew quarterly revs in the mid-teen percentages as COVID caused a slowdown in growth, the company has been incredibly consistent at posting revenue growth in the 20+% range every quarter of the past five years. We like seeing this level of consistency in a well-established company like ADBE, as it shows that the company has a very resilient business model.</li><li> Revenue growth was primarily driven by ADBE's largest segment, Digital Media (~73% of total revs), which grew nicely at 23% yr/yr. The biggest component of Digital Media is ADBE's Creative business (~83% of Digital Media revs), made up of its cloud-based content creating products such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom. Although these products are, for the most part, industry standards in video and photo editing, we think their ability to assist developers in creating augmented reality (AR) and 3D models will continue to keep the wind at ADBE's back moving forward. </li><li>Furthermore, Document Cloud, the other component of ADBE's Digital Media segment, continued to be a shining star, jumping 31% yr/yr and still growing more quickly than all of ADBE's lines of business. Document Cloud has grown at least 30% yr/yr in the past three quarters as many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have continued to turn to digital signature platforms.</li><li>  Finally, ADBE's Digital Experience segment saw a nice leap in revenue of 26% yr/yr in Q3. Most of ADBE's products within this segment focus on delivering data insights for businesses and are subscription-based, providing a steady revenue stream. Key end customers include <strong>CVS Pharmacy (CVS)</strong>, <strong>Facebook (FB)</strong>, and <strong>Ford (F)</strong>. We see ADBE's Digital Experience offerings as great complements to its Digital Media segment as these solutions allow content creators and companies' marketing departments to edit, publish, and drive insights into different advertisements and forms of media. </li></ul><p>Although it is not showing in the stock today, ADBE posted another consistent quarter of solid growth. During FY21, ADBE hasn't had a real laggard in any of its lines of business. Although Digital Experience revenue growth lagged overall growth last year, ADBE took the steps necessary to shift its focus toward data analytics, helping to strengthen this segment's revenue growth thus far this year. We view this as a testament to ADBE's strength in business operations, which helps drive consistent revenue growth. </p><p>Bottom line, as the world economy shifts toward more digital activity, ADBE is in an excellent position to capitalize on this transformation. However, its rich valuation of 52x forward earnings doesn't give the company much room for error, and we think it's better to await further pullbacks. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
