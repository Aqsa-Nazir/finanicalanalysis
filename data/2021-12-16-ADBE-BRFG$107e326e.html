<html><body><p><strong>Adobe (ADBE -8%)</strong> closed out FY21 on a bit of a down note. Adobe has been posting big EPS beats, mostly in the double-digits the since the pandemic began, benefitting from the pandemic which has caused more companies and consumers to shift to digital document creation. So when Adobe posted basically in-line results this morning for Q4 (Nov), investors were disappointed. Plus it guided below expectations for Q1 (Feb) and FY22. </p><p>In addition to digital documents, the pandemic also accelerated the need for digital transformations among businesses of all sizes. Small and mid-sized businesses had to quickly set up digital storefronts while enterprise customers that had not yet made substantial digital investments took the leap. Entire industries from media and entertainment to pharma, retail, automotive, and financial services had to pivot nearly overnight to digital operations. </p><ul><li> Digital Media, Adobe's largest segment (which is comprised of Creative and Document Cloud), saw revenue grow 21% yr/yr to $3.01 bln, a bit better than prior guidance of +20%. However, it was a bit of a slowdown from Q3's +23% growth. Also, the Q1 guidance for this segment points to a deceleration at +17%. Granted, Adobe is known for conservative guidance, but the overall trend is not great. </li><li>Within the Digital Media segment, Adobe also tracks Creative revenue, which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Lightroom, and InDesign. An example here might be a small business owner designing her first website. Creative revenue grew 19% yr/yr to $2.48 bln, which also was a bit of a slowdown from Q3's +21% growth. </li><li> Document Cloud revenue grew nicely at 29% yr/yr to $532 mln, which was a nice acceleration from +21% in Q3. That helped to mitigate some softness on the Creative side. </li><li>Adobe's other big segment is Digital Experience, which allows businesses to manage/track customer experiences using analytics. Segment revenue grew 23% yr/yr to $1.01 bln, a bit better than +22% prior guidance. However, that's also a decline from +26% growth in Q3 and the Q1 guidance of +18% growth is also not a great trend. </li></ul><p> <strong>Bottom line, Adobe had been blowing away analyst expectations for much of the pandemic.</strong> As such, an in-line result and downside guidance is pretty surprising. Also, the decelerating growth trend from Q3 to Q4 to Q1 is not great. In fact, we're a little surprised the stock is not down more. Even though the numbers were not that far off, oftentimes downside guidance from a perennial upsider can really change the psychology around a stock and lead to a sell-off. Also, Adobe reminds us a bit of <strong>DocuSign (DOCU)</strong>, another document creator with booming results since the pandemic began, but it dropped sharply in early December on weak guidance. We think Adobe's reputation for being conservative on guidance is helping to prevent a bigger sell-off. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
