<html><body><p>After the company reported Q4 results last night, shares of <strong>eBay (EBAY -2%)</strong> are trading lower, although they have bounced off their opening lows. The quarter's numbers were actually generally good; EPS exceeded high side of prior guidance while revenue was in line with estimates. Also, eBay announced a 22% increase to its dividend and expanded its share repurchase authorization by an additional $4 bln. </p><ul><li>However, eBay offered downside guidance for Q1 and 2022 for both EPS and revenue. Additionally, we view eBay's forecast for GMV to decline by 5-8% on an FX-neutral basis as disappointing. </li><li> eBay expects to experience a tough 1H22 as it laps significant mobility and macro tailwinds from 2021. Management expects a 1H22 GMV decline in the mid-teens on an FX-neutral basis. At the same time, margins will be pressured as the company scales investments sequentially. </li><li> Results should improve in 2H22, when the company believes that it should observe the cleanest yr/yr comps since entering the pandemic. Hopefully the improvements it has been making will start to translate into financial results/metrics by that time. </li><li> eBay has been undergoing a major change in recent years by migrating customers away from PayPal and toward eBay's internal Managed Payments platform. That transition was at last completed in Q4; eBay has now migrated all remaining sellers away from the legacy system. The goal of the transition is to remove transactional friction and provide more trusted service. </li><li>Active buyers have been declining in recent quarters. eBay ended 2021 with 147 mln active buyers on a TTM basis, representing a 9% yr/yr decline. That is a step up from the 5% decline seen in Q3. However, eBay has been focused on attracting high value buyers and letting low value buyers fall by the wayside, so it's not the end of the world. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, the Q4 results were decent, but the guidance is spooking investors, especially the GMV outlook for 1H22.</strong> It seems that 2022 will shape up as a year of two halves, with results getting better later in the year. With that said, the stock is holding up fairly well today, especially given the general weakness in the markets today in connection with the Russia/Ukraine conflict. We think the stock's action may be a slight positive, as it suggests that a lot of negativity was priced in already after the stock had dropped from $81 in late October to around $53. The dividend increase and large buyback may be helping to support the stock as well. However, investors should brace for difficult results in Q1 and Q2 as eBay laps tough comparisons and ramps up spending.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
