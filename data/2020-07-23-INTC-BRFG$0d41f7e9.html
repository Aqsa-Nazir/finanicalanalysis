<html><body><p><strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> is set to report Q2 results today after the close with a call to follow at 5pm ET. Current CapitalIQ consensus for EPS is $1.11 and for revenue it's $18.55 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter in the press release. In April, Intel guided to Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approx. $1.10 and revenue of approx. $18.50 bln.</p><ul><li> <strong>Expectations for semiconductor companies are running high this earnings season </strong>as several companies have reported strong results (like <strong>TXN </strong>on Tuesday and <strong>MU </strong>in late June) while several others have increased guidance in the past couple of weeks or so, including <strong>ADI, MXIM, IMOS, FORM, MXL, XLNX</strong>.  <ul><li>In fairness, Intel is not a direct comparison as it does more than make chips. </li><li>INTC has been transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, the latter of which accounted for 48% of revenue in 2019. </li><li>Its data center segment is focused on cloud computing, network infrastructure, and intelligent edge applications as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G.  </li></ul></li><li>The PC side is not seeing a lot of growth but Intel recently began shipping its 10nm Intel Core processors, which feature a new core architecture. INTC is on track to launch its first 7nm-based product, a discrete GPU, at the end of 2021. </li><li>Intel's top line growth tends to be pretty modest. However, the company also tends to be consistent relative to consensus estimates as it has not missed on EPS in any quarter over the past five years. And its EPS beats have been getting larger in recent quarters, with four consecutive double digit EPS beats. </li><li><strong>Overall, some big tech names have reported, but we are still early in the tech reporting cycle.</strong><ul><li>We think Intel should have pretty good results. IBM had a nice quarter and said large enterprise customers are still spending. </li><li>TXN's quarter is a good sign for Intel as well. </li><li>Also, <strong>Microsoft (MSFT) </strong>had a mixed quarter, but its consumer/PC side did well with more people working at home. This is good news for Intel's PC business.</li></ul></li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
