<html><body><p><strong>Adobe (ADBE -14%)</strong> is heading sharply lower following its Q3 (Aug) earnings report this morning. The timing was a surprise, because it had been scheduled for today after the close. However, Adobe moved it up to the pre-market likely because the company also announced some big news on the M&amp;A front: it will acquire Figma, a web-first collaborative design platform, for approximately $20 bln. Half is being paid in cash and half in stock. </p><ul><li> Let's tackle the earnings first. Adobe posted a solid EPS beat, its largest in the past four quarters, while revs were in-line. The Q4 (Nov) guidance was a bit disappointing with upside EPS but slight downside revs. </li><li>Its Digital Media segment performed well with revenue rising 13% yr/yr to $3.23 bln. Growth slowed a bit from +15% yr/yr in Q2 (May), but still was a solid result. Within this segment, Creative revenue grew +11% to $2.63 bln, while Document Cloud revenue jumped 23% yr/yr to $607 mln. Adobe's other major segment is Digital Experience, which saw revenue grow 14% yr/yr to $1.12 bln, also a bit lower from +17% in Q2. </li><li>This was going to be an interesting quarter because Adobe bumped up prices in late Q2, its first real change since 2017. We were not sure how customers would respond, but they seem to have not pushed back too hard. Also, Adobe notes that it has added many new features since the last price increase. Adobe probably could have gotten an even bigger price increase, but wanted to focus more on adding millions of new users. Adobe sees itself as a growth business at heart. </li><li>Turning to the Figma deal, this is a $20 bln transaction, so it is quite large relative to Adobe's $150 bln market cap. Figma is geared toward people who design mobile and web applications by allowing them to collaborate through multi-player workflows, sophisticated design systems and a developer ecosystem. Figma is used by millions of developers. Adobe already offers a collaborative design platform with its XD product but Figma adds a lot of capabilities and a huge built-in base of customers. </li><li> With more people working remotely, it makes sense to focus more on design platforms that allow for collaboration from different locations. However, the one thing investors may not like is that half of the deal is being financed with stock. That does seem a bit high and will dilute shareholder value. Also, it provides a clue that maybe management thinks its stock price is high, which is not great from a sentiment perspective.</li></ul><p>Overall, the stock is sharply lower on today's news. We think the combination of mediocre guidance, yr/yr growth for its major segments slowing a bit from Q2 plus the high price being paid for Figma is spooking investors ($20 bln while Figma's ARR is just north of $400 mln). With the economy looking a bit weak and the Fed raising rates, is this really the best time to shell out $20 bln for an acquisition, especially with half of that being stock?</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
