<html><body><p>Keeping up with demand in this supply constrained environment has proven to be a very formidable challenge for <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>). With fuel costs surging, the degree of difficulty has been lifted even higher as interest in electric vehicles (EVs) hits another gear. According to Electrek, TSLA's order rates have skyrocketed: the EV maker saw a 100% increase in certain parts of the country over the past week.<br><br aria-hidden="true">In what seems to be a very positive development for TSLA, this news isn't as bullish as it may seem -- at least, not in the near term, for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>This new wave of orders won't translate into deliveries any time soon. During TSLA's 4Q21 earnings conference call, CFO Zach Kirkhorn commented that the company's Fremont and Shanghai factories have been running below capacity for quite some time.<ul><li>While TSLA has done well to mitigate the well-documented chip shortages, it's still struggling to secure enough parts and components to fully meet demand.</li><li>Consequently, order backlog has ballooned to the point where a new Model Y order may not be shipped until this fall.</li></ul></li><li>Adding another burst of demand to an already highly strained supply chain will likely exacerbate the problem. It stands to reason that<strong> Ford Motors</strong> (<strong>F</strong>), <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>), and other EV manufacturers are experiencing a similar surge in orders.<ul><li>Even prior to this jump in gas prices, enthusiasm for Ford's and GM's new EVs was off the charts. In fact, Ford had to cut off reservations for its Maverick pickup truck, while GM had to do the same for the Cadillac LYRIQ.</li></ul></li><li>Relatedly, an intensifying supply/demand imbalance for chips and other parts could apply even more upward pressure on EV prices. Recall that last week, <strong>Rivian</strong> (<strong>RIVN</strong>) announced a 20% increase on its selling prices due to inflationary pressures, causing customer cancellation rates to rise by alarming rates, according to Electrek.</li></ul><p>From a big picture perspective, the rush of new orders further solidifies the premise that EVs are now entering a golden age. For TSLA, the opening of new factories in Texas and Germany this year will take some strain off its two primary factories, but ramping EV production takes time. Perhaps by the time those new factories are fully operational, the supply chain will be in better shape, allowing TSLA to cash in on this very favorable demand environment.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
