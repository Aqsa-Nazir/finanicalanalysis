<html><body><p>Concerns about softening demand have been percolating in the background for <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) over the past few months as rising interest rates and inflation take a toll on the global economy. Those concerns were ratcheted up a notch this morning after <em>Bloomberg</em> broke a story that the electric vehicle maker is cutting its December Model Y production by 20% at its Shanghai plant. TSLA has since refuted the story, but the stock is still trading sharply lower, signaling that investors remain uneasy about the demand situation.<br><br>The report also comes on the heels of a 5-10% price cut in October for TSLA's Model 3 and Model Y in China, and this ominous tweet from Elon Musk on November 30: "Trend is concerning. Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately. They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession."</p><ul><li>A slowdown in demand would be especially problematic right now because TSLA has aggressively ramped up its production. Not only is the company boosting output at its recently launched Austin, Texas and Berlin, Germany facilities, but it also recently modernized and reconfigured its Shanghai plant to increase production. In fact, Shanghai churned out a record 100,290 vehicles in November, according to CPCA data, which represents a new monthly record for TSLA.</li><li>The good news is that higher production leads to greater manufacturing efficiencies, which is a positive for automotive gross margin and operating margin. In Q3, automotive gross margin remained flat sequentially at 27.9%, despite facing a difficult comp in Q2 when ASPs jumped due to a lower mix of production coming from Shanghai. However, if demand wavers, the increase in output could translate into ballooning inventory levels and ultimately more price cuts and sagging margins.</li></ul><p>China's strict zero-COVID policy has strained the supply chain in the automotive industry, and in other industries, putting pressure on both businesses and consumers in that country. The competitive landscape is also intensifying with <strong>NIO</strong> (<strong>NIO</strong>), <strong>XPeng</strong> (<strong>XPEV</strong>), and <strong>Li Auto</strong> (<strong>LI</strong>) gaining ground in China. Each of those stocks began the session with sizable gains, likely on reports of some Chinese cities loosening COVID restrictions, but those gains have since been wiped out.<br><br>While there seems to be plenty of smoke building around the slowing demand narrative for TSLA, there's a couple key points to keep in mind.</p><ul><li>Some buyers in the U.S. are holding off on making a purchase until January 1, when the new $7,500 tax credit kicks in. Therefore, any weakness seen in December could be made up in January as buyers look to take advantage of the incentives.</li><li>Last week, <em>Electrek </em>reported that TSLA is planning a major increase of Model Y production at its Austin, Texas facility in 1Q23. Specifically, it's believed that the company is expecting to ramp the production rate up to 5,000 vehicles per week throughout the entire quarter. For context, TSLA reported that Austin was making about 1,000 Model Y's back in June. If TSLA was anticipating a significant deceleration in demand, it wouldn't be as aggressive in its production plans for Q1.</li></ul><p>The bottom line is that the demand environment has become more challenging for TSLA. During the Q3 earnings conference call, Musk admitted as much, stating that&nbsp;"demand is a little harder than it would otherwise be" as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. With that said, sales are certainly not falling off a cliff, as illustrated by the 90% increase in November deliveries from TSLA's Shanghai plant.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
