<html><body><p>While <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) struggles through a painful transformation centered on building out its manufacturing base in the U.S., the company has watched rivals like <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) and <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) soar as an emerging AI boom is fueling robust demand for more powerful chips. However, INTC may have identified a way to quickly make up some ground in the AI race by leaning on the old adage, "if you can't beat them, join them."&nbsp;<br><br>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, INTC is in talks with semiconductor giant Arm Ltd. to become an anchor investor in Arm's upcoming IPO, which will undoubtedly be the event of the year for an IPO market that's still trying to break out of a deep slump. There are still many uncertainties at this point, including the amount of capital that INTC is considering investing. Also, the IPO specifics, including an expected date and the projected price range, are currently unknown.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>What is certain, though, is that <strong>Softbank </strong>(<strong>SFTBY</strong>) owned Arm is a dominant force in the semiconductor industry with its chip designs powering the technology behind devices and products from <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>), Samsung, <strong>Qualcomm</strong> (<strong>QCOM</strong>), and INTC. </li><li>In fact, NVDA thought so highly of Arm that it tried to acquire the company for $40 bln in 2020, only to see the deal fall apart a couple years later due to regulatory pressures.</li><li>Arm's portfolio of AI-ready chips is a major reason why NVDA was willing to shell out tens of billions of dollars to acquire the company. Arm's AI-optimized platform architecture is at the center of its GPU, CPU, and NPU product families. By investing in Arm's IPO, INTC would participate in the anticipated upswing in demand for these chips as AI becomes increasingly prevalent in virtually every industry.</li></ul><p>While it's clear that INTC has fallen behind the competition, the company does appear to be moving in the right direction. </p><ul><li>Revenue in Q1 did collapse by 36% yr/yr and gross margin did tumble lower by 15 percentage points yr/yr, but INTC issued inline Q2 revenue guidance after guiding revenue below expectations in every quarter last year. </li><li>Additionally, during the earnings call, CEO Pat&nbsp;Gelsinger stated that he's seeing signs of stability in the PC market with inventory corrections proceeding as anticipated.</li></ul><p>Lastly, Arm's impending IPO will have massive implications for the IPO market overall. </p><ul><li>Some green shoots have already emerged this year as <strong>Kenvue</strong> (<strong>KVUE</strong>), the<strong> Johnson &amp; Johnson </strong>(<strong>JNJ</strong>) consumer health spin-off, generated solid demand for its deal in early May. </li><li>However, a strong pricing and debut from Arm could qualify as the catalyst that breaks the door open for other companies waiting on the sidelines to go public. </li><li>With a substantial backing from INTC, and with investors' insatiable appetite for AI-based investments in its corner, a successful IPO for Arm seems highly likely.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that a sizable investment in Arm's IPO looks like a win-win-win scenario in our view for INTC, Arm, and for the IPO market. Many details are still missing, and an Arm IPO may still be a few months away, but this development inspires some much-needed confidence in INTC's AI-based aspirations.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
