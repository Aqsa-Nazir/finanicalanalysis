<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN +12%)</strong> is surging today following its Q2 earnings report last night. Revenue was above the high end of prior guidance and the mid-point of guidance was above analyst expectations. AMZN did report a GAAP loss, but you can disregard that because it includes an unusual item. </p><ul><li> <strong>The more important metric for profitability is operating income,</strong> which at $3.317 bln was above prior guidance of $(1)-3 bln. It is frustrating that AMZN does not provide an adjusted EPS number, but that makes the comparison to operating income all the more important because it is a clean apples-to-apples comparison as the unusual charge is below the operating income line. The one slight negative is that the Q3 operating income guidance of $0-3.5 bln is below analyst expectations. </li><li><strong>What stands out to us was the robust performance from its online sales segment. </strong>With <strong>WMT </strong>guiding lower, <strong>SHOP</strong> reporting a miss, and <strong>BBY </strong>lowering comps this week, we were bracing for weak results. However, AMZN performed well and that was despite Prime Day switching to Q3 this year from Q2 in 2021. </li><li><strong>AWS was a bright spot,</strong> with revenue rising 33% yr/yr to $19.75 bln. The top line growth has certainly moderated in recent quarters, even at constant currency (CC). However, this is not unusual as AWS grows in size. Also, <strong>MSFT's</strong> Azure is seeing a similar pattern. AWS continues to grow at a fast pace, and AMZN believes it is still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector adoption of the cloud. </li><li><strong>Advertising Services segment </strong>revenue rose 18% yr/yr (+21% CC) to $8.757 bln, a bit below Q1's CC growth of +25%. However, that is quite good relative to <strong>Facebook</strong>, which posted its first ever drop in revenue. Ad growth at Google also slowed and look at the ugly reports from <strong>SNAP </strong>and <strong>ROKU </strong>this week. We think this result is quite impressive in a deteriorating online ad environment. </li><li><strong>One of the main criticisms with AMZN</strong> is that it overexpanded capacity/workers during the pandemic, when it was caught flat-footed. To its credit, AMZN has since slowed its 2022-23 operations expansion plans. This should help offset the inflationary pressures AMZN is facing, namely higher fuel, trucking, air/ocean shipping rates and higher energy costs at its data centers. </li></ul><p>Overall, this was a great report. Not so much for the raw numbers blowing us away, but AMZN certainly posted impressive results at every segment. Given all the recent bad news from retailers and ad-related companies this week, we were bracing for a rough result. But we tip our cap to AMZN for a surprisingly good quarter and the stock has nearly closed the April gap lower.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
