<html><body><strong>Tesla's</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) brash CEO, Elon Musk, has been having plenty of fun lately with the satirical cryptocurrency Dogecoin, substantially moving its price around through his <strong>Twitter</strong> (<strong>TWTR</strong>) feed. Meanwhile, the situation that's unfolding in China -- TSLA's second largest market at ~30% of sales -- is no laughing matter for the company or its investors.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Earlier this morning, <em>Reuters</em> reported that TSLA has halted plans to purchase land to expand its Shanghai facility, which currently produces a total of about 450,000 Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs per year. Furthermore, the leading electric vehicle (EV) maker purportedly intends to slow production in China.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The news is quite stunning given TSLA's meteoric growth in China and its presumed aspirations to significantly expand operations there. In March, Model 3/Model Y sales more than tripled yr/yr to 35,479 units, despite the global chip shortage that has undermined other major automakers. An expansion at the Shanghai plant would have allowed TSLA to boost production by at least 200,000 vehicles while providing a hub to ship vehicles into Europe and possibly the U.S.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">TSLA's abrupt shift is mainly being attributed to the 25% tariff on imported Chinese vehicles that the Trump Administration put into place. Perhaps there was some anticipation on TSLA's part that President Biden would ease the tariff burden. So far, though, the Biden Administration has largely maintained the tough stance on trade with China.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However, there's much more to the story than just tariffs. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Over the past two months, public relations troubles have hit TSLA in China, damaging the company's reputation in the process. First, the Chinese government banned TSLA's vehicles from entering military installations due to concerns that sensitive data could be captured by cameras and sensors on the EVs. The accusation likely created some distrust among Chinese consumers.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then, a disgruntled customer made a major spectacle during a Shanghai auto show by climbing on top of a TSLA vehicle and showing a video of an accident that allegedly resulted from faulty brakes. The incident went viral as the media and social media outlets highlighted a multitude of complaints regarding poor service and repair capabilities at TSLA.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The onslaught seems to have had an impact, since TSLA sales in China slid by 27% from March to April, according to China's Passenger Car Association. It is worth noting, though, that March was an exceptionally strong month for TSLA.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">China is a critical component of TSLA's overall business and growth strategy, so any material change there is going to be felt on a fundamental basis. TSLA is also important to the Chinese economy and the government's plan to sharply ramp up EV production in the coming years. The fact that TSLA is the only foreign automaker allowed to produce vehicles in China without a domestic joint partner is quite telling. Given the mutually beneficial relationship, we believe it's likely that the company will ultimately iron out its issues there and may even revisit its expansion plans down the road sometime.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
