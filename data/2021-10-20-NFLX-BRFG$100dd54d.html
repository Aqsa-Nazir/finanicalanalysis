<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX -2%)</strong> is streaming modestly lower today despite reporting upside for EPS and global streaming net adds in its third quarter results. However, we think a big quarter was priced in, given the big move that the stock had made since mid-August. This was partly fueled by excitement about Netflix's surprise hit, <em>Squid Game</em>, which has become the company's biggest TV show ever. Also, the Q4 EPS guidance was below expectations due to plans to ramp up content creation. </p><ul><li><strong>Netflix reported a huge EPS beat. </strong>That beat included a large FX gain, which takes some of the shine off the final number. However, NFLX also reported operating margin that was upside relative to prior guidance, so it does look like an EPS beat. Revenue was right in-line. The main negative was that NFLX guided to Q4 EPS of just $0.80, well below the $1.13 consensus, while there was slight upside to Q4 revenue guidance. </li><li><strong>It's becoming more difficult to know what to expect from Netflix's earnings. </strong>As a global company, Netflix faces significant FX fluctuations. Plus, it's difficult to predict production costs, which have a huge impact on EPS. That was evident in the Q4 EPS guidance: NFLX forecasts a 19% yr/yr increase in content amortization for Q4, compared with ~8% growth YTD. To top it off, NFLX, rather than providing a range for EPS guidance, gives just one number, making it more challenging for analysts to develop their models. Our point here is that investors should put less emphasis on EPS and EPS guidance; there are too many moving parts and accounting adjustments. Focus more on subscriber metrics. </li><li><strong>Global streaming paid net additions were +4.38 mln vs +3.50 mln prior guidance.</strong> We view that as a pretty good but not great number, considering that NFLX was lapping an easy +2.20 mln comp last year. More than half of Q3's growth came from Asia; we would have preferred more US growth. Net adds are being helped by better content. After delivering a light content slate in 1H21 due to COVID-related production delays in 2020, NFLX is seeing the positive effects of a stronger slate in 2H21. </li><li><strong>In terms of other important metrics</strong>, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU keeps growing at $14.68 vs $14.54 in Q2 and vs $13.40 a year ago. Q3 operating margin came in at 23.5% vs 20.7% prior guidance. However, Q4 operating margin guidance calls for an operating margin of just 6.5% vs 14.4% in 4Q20, driven by that larger amortization for content. </li><li><strong>Looking ahead, NFLX expects a more normalized content slate in 2022,</strong> with a greater number of originals in 2022 vs. 2021 and a release schedule that is more balanced over the course of the year. For NFLX to return to normal in 2022 will be very welcome. Many disruptions have impacted the company's performance during the last two years, including the pull-forward of subscribers and delays on the content production side; it has been difficult to know to what extent these were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and to what extent they were attributable to the underlying business. </li></ul><p><strong>This was a good quarter for Netflix, but it did not blow us away.</strong> Net adds were decent but were a bit of a letdown given last year's easy comp. The Q4 EPS/margin downside guidance does not bother us too much, as it is being driven largely by content amortization rather than any sort of a slowdown in the business. Overall, we are surprised the stock is holding up as well as it is. The stock made a huge 22% run from mid-August to mid-October; that is sort of a blowout quarter move, and this was not that.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
