<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> is returning to the restaurant delivery business today through its commercial agreement with <strong>Just Eat Takeaway.com's (JTKWY)</strong> Grubhub. The company will offer US Amazon Prime members a free one-year Grubhub membership with zero delivery fees. The announcement coincides with AMZN taking a 2% stake in Just Eat. The deal also allows AMZN to step up its stake to 15%. </p><p>AMZN first tried its hand at the restaurant delivery business nearly seven years ago with Amazon Restaurants, only to shut down operations in 2019. At the time, established players in the space, such as Grubhub, Uber Eats <strong>(UBER)</strong>, and <strong>DoorDash (DASH)</strong>, increased their efforts to squash AMZN, offering hefty discounts to capture market share from the e-commerce giant. Now, after the pandemic's benefits have dwindled, AMZN's move is spooking Uber  and DoorDash, whose shares have tumbled around 50% on the year.</p><p> With investors not clamoring for food delivery service stocks like UBER and DASH this year, <strong>why is AMZN entering back into this market? </strong></p><ul><li>Even though it has not shown up in stock performance, UBER and DASH have continued to enjoy a growing user base despite mobility bouncing back toward pre-pandemic levels. For example, DASH reached new record highs in its monthly active users (MAUs) and DashPass members in Q1 while growing total orders by 23% yr/yr on top of +219% growth in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, UberEats saw its gross bookings triple as of Q4 from 1Q20, as new verticals such as grocery and convenience stores drove additional growth. </li><li>Grocery delivery is a major reason we think AMZN is returning to the food delivery market. AMZN already offers grocery delivery through its Whole Foods locations and has been delivering groceries in select markets for over a decade. Furthermore, delivery demand has remained robust even with grocery stores reopened since the pandemic. <ul><li> In AprQ, <strong>Kroger (KR)</strong> witnessed delivery sales increase significantly in its pilot membership program, where customers pay zero delivery fees.</li><li>  UBER expects its expanded partnership with <strong>Albertsons (ACI)</strong>, alongside other grocery partners, to fuel a significant acceleration in UberEats growth in the second half of FY22. </li></ul></li><li> With Just Eat also announcing that it is pursuing a partial or complete sale of Grubhub, we think AMZN is testing the waters before possibly pulling the trigger on acquiring the food delivery company. </li></ul><p> AMZN's return to the restaurant delivery industry is receiving just a lukewarm reaction today. With Just Eat shares plummeting roughly 70% YTD, AMZN investors may not be very excited about its 2% stake in Just Eat, as well as its partnership with Grubhub, whose shares were in freefall before being acquired last year. </p><p><strong>Still, we think AMZN's move makes more sense now than it did in 2015</strong>. We believe that consumers would like to see consolidation in the food delivery market, and adding it as a bonus for Amazon Prime users (or possibly as a minor extra monthly cost in the future) is the right step toward capitalizing on sustained restaurant delivery demand. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
