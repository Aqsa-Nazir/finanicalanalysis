<html><body><p>Something had to give as <strong>Intel's</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) earnings, margins, and cash flow continue to erode as the chip maker's primary PC and server markets grapple with macroeconomic headwinds and an associated inventory supply imbalance. That "something" turned out to be INTC's lofty quarterly dividend, which was sporting an annualized yield of about 5.6% before today's announcement. Specifically, the company announced a new quarterly dividend of $0.125/share, representing a 66% cut from the prior payout.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The decision to slash the dividend doesn't come as a major surprise. In fact, INTC's executives were asked about that possibility during the 4Q22 earnings call in late January. Falling short of fully committing to the former $0.365/share quarterly dividend, INTC simply stated that it intends to maintain a "competitive dividend."</li><li>However, with INTC issuing a very bleak outlook for 1Q23 (which was reaffirmed today), including its first quarterly loss in many years and an expected 40% yr/yr plunge in revenue, the huge dividend was really looking unsustainable. </li><li>On that note, INTC's cash flow from operations was nearly cut in half in FY22, coming in at $15.4 bln. Of that amount, nearly $6.0 bln was paid out in the form of dividends. With FY22 net income of about $8.0 bln, the dividend payout ratio penciled out to an unfeasible 75%.</li></ul><p>The dividend isn't the only item that INTC has targeted in its pursuit to shore up its financials.</p><ul><li>In Q4, the company implemented a significant workforce reduction plan and began rationalizing its investments around areas that it believes hold the highest long-term value. Today, INTC reiterated that it intends to deliver $3.0 bln in cost savings in FY23, putting it on a path to achieve $8-$10 bln in annualized savings by the end of 2025.</li><li>Rewinding a bit further, INTC spun-off its <strong>Mobileye</strong> (<strong>MBLY</strong>) autonomous driving unit on October 26 via an IPO which valued the company at $16.7 bln. That valuation looked like a fire sale price because MBLY was expected to fetch a $50+ bln valuation only a year before the IPO launched. Indeed, the decision to unload MBLY now looks a bit hasty as shares have nearly doubled versus the $21/share IPO price.</li></ul><p>The spin-off, layoffs, and dividend cut are all intended to improve INTC's financial flexibility as it moves ahead with its transformation of becoming a domestic chip producer. </p><ul><li>Last July, the company announced plans for an initial investment of more than $20 bln to construct two chip factories in Ohio. Over the next decade, INTC's investments in these plants could exceed $100 bln.</li><li>In the meantime, the company's margins continue to take a massive hit as it ramps up its investments and as its end markets tumble. Gross margin in Q4 collapsed to 43.8% from 55.8% in the year-earlier quarter. Worse yet, INTC guided for a huge sequential decline to just 39.0%.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that the dividend cut was both necessary and anticipated, explaining why the stock is holding up quite well today. The fact that INTC also reaffirmed its 1Q23 guidance doesn't hurt either, providing some relief that its business has at least stabilized over the past month.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
