<html><body><p><strong>eBay (EBAY -6%)</strong> is trading lower despite reporting upside for both EPS and revenue and guiding in-line for Q3. In fact, this was eBay's largest EPS beat in the past five years. We think its active buyer metric and cautious comments on the call are perhaps making investors a bit nervous. </p><ul><li>Let's start with the good stuff. eBay delivered better than expected results, including GMV. Its focus categories, payments and advertising helped offset macro headwinds like the war in Ukraine (eBay has a lot of business in Europe), FX headwinds, rising inflation and weakening consumer discretionary spend. Non-GAAP operating margin did slip yr/yr to 28.7% from 32.8% a year ago, but that is still a good number considering last year benefitted from robust activity as the vaccine was just rolling out and many consumers continued to buy online. </li><li>eBay continues to make progress in bolstering its focus categories. The company was also excited about its eBay Refurbished platform as it added more trusted sellers and expanded categories in the program (headphones, audio, gaming consoles, smart home devices). Refurbished products are growing faster than new products in the same category. </li><li> Coming into this report we were nervous about advertising services given the stumbles in some other online ad companies. Despite the macro environment, ad rates and adoption continue to grow due to the high return on ad spend. In Q2, its ads business accelerated faster than volume and delivered revenue that was nearly 1.5% of GMV. </li></ul><p> <strong>So why is the stock down?</strong> We think it may be that its TTM active buyers keeps falling. This metric has dropped sequentially in each of the past four quarters and now stands at 138 mln, down from 142 mln in Q1 and 156 mln in 2Q21. A decline is not surprising as consumers are shopping more at brick-and-mortar. However, this metric has dropped 4-5 mln sequentially in each of the past four quarters. We would have liked to have seen some stabilization by now, but maybe that happens in Q3/Q4. </p><p>Also, while eBay did provide in-line Q3 guidance, management sounded a bit cautious on the call. They said the operating environment remains difficult to predict. Plus, the spread of COVID variants, persistent supply chain issues, elevated inflation, and rising interest rates will likely wear on consumer discretionary spend...and the kicker here: "for some time." That is not exactly a ringing endorsement and these problems may persist for a while. On a final note, eBay deserves credit for aggressively buying back $1.3 bln of its shares in Q2, which computes as nearly 5% of shares outstanding in just one quarter, which is a huge amount.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
