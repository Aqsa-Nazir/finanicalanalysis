<html><body><p>In the aftermath of last week's disappointing 4Q21 earnings report from&nbsp;<strong>Meta Platform's</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>), regulatory concerns faded to the background as the <strong>Apple </strong>(<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy change and rising competition from Tiktok consumed everyone's attention. Today, however, those regulatory concerns are back in focus after <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that the company may pull Facebook and Instagram from Europe if it's unable to keep transferring user data back to the U.S.<br><br>For some context, in August 2020, the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) issued a preliminary finding, stating that FB's reliance on&nbsp;Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to transfer data from Europe to the U.S. does not&nbsp;achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, the commission determined that FB's transfers of data should be suspended. Since then, U.S. and European Union regulators have attempted to restructure a new transatlantic data transfer pact, but a deal has yet to be struck. Without an agreement in place, a final decision on the IDPC's ruling looms, with FB expecting a conclusion to the matter as early as 1H22.<br><br>A negative final decision poses a significant threat for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Like in the U.S., the data that FB attains from its European subscribers is used for targeted advertising -- the bread and butter of its business. At nearly 25% of FY21 revenue, Europe represents a major market for FB and any significant disruption there would materially impact revenue.<ul><li>For a point of comparison, Europe accounted for 16% of <strong>Snap's </strong>(<strong>SNAP</strong>) revenue in FY21. According to the Business Help Center page of Snap's website, the company is fully compliant with GDPR and UK data protection laws.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>With pressures mounting against FB's Family of Apps segment (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), the company may be compelled to pour even more capital into its metaverse aspirations. While these investments could pay dividends several years down the road, FB's earnings would take an even bigger short-term hit if it accelerates its metaverse timeline.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In our view, FB's threat to completely remove Facebook and Instagram is a tactic to put political pressure on regulators to not disrupt the millions of people and businesses that use its platforms in Europe. It reminds us of the strategy that ride-sharing companies <strong>Uber</strong> (<strong>UBER</strong>) and <strong>Lyft</strong> (<strong>LYFT</strong>) implemented in California, threatening to leave the state if Proposition 22 did not pass. Ultimately, it would be completely shocking if FB followed through on this threat, given how important the European market is to the company. A more likely scenario is that FB settles for a more restrictive data transfer agreement, and/or moves ahead with a new monetization strategy that doesn't rely as heavily on targeted ads.&nbsp;</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
