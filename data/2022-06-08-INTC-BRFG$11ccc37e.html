<html><body><p><strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) is a notable laggard today after the company's CFO, David Zinsner, offered disconcerting commentary about the macroeconomic environment during the <strong>Bank of America</strong> (<strong>BAC</strong>) Global Technology Conference. The event actually took place yesterday afternoon, but Zinsner didn't present until 5:30 p.m. E.T, well after the market had already closed. When he did speak, he said that the macro environment is weaker than INTC anticipated coming into the quarter, and that he expects customers to reduce inventory levels, negatively impacting demand for INTC's chips.<br><br>Earlier this morning, <strong>Citigroup</strong> (<strong>C</strong>) analyst Christopher Danely put Zinsner's remarks under the spotlight, commenting that his bear-case scenario on INTC was&nbsp;'taking shape even earlier' than expected. He reiterated his Neutral rating on INTC, but noted that he expects INTC to negatively pre-announce or miss its Q2 guidance. When INTC reported Q1 earnings on April 28, it issued downside Q2 EPS and revenue guidance of $0.70 and $18.0 bln, respectively.</p><p>These developments are reverberating across the semiconductor space with <strong>Micron</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>), <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>),<strong> Texas Instruments</strong> (<strong>TXN</strong>), among others, also displaying relative weakness. However, Zinsner's apparent warning doesn't necessarily indicate that a full-scale downturn is developing in the semiconductor industry.</p><ul><li>Recall that INTC's disappointing Q2 guidance was primarily related to weakness in its Client Computing Group (CCG), which provides chips for PCs, notebooks, and laptops. This segment experienced a 13% drop in Q1 revenue&nbsp;due to softening demand and component supply constraints resulting from COVID-related lockdowns in China. INTC's Data Center and AI (DCAI) segment, though, generated growth of 22%, driven by robust demand from hyperscalers that fueled strong sales for its Xeon processors.<ul><li>Relatedly, on May 27, fellow chip maker <strong>Marvell</strong> (<strong>MRVL</strong>) reported solid Q1 results and issued an upbeat outlook as data center end market revenue soared by 131% yr/yr. Like INTC, the company credited strong demand from its hyperscaler customers for its performance.</li></ul></li><li>About a month before MRVL's encouraging report, <strong>Qualcomm </strong>(<strong>QCOM</strong>) issued an impressive beat-and-raise report, easing fears that the global semiconductor market is buckling under the weight of supply chain disruptions and waning demand for mobile phones. QCOM's results and outlook demonstrated that more diversified semiconductor companies with exposure to higher-growth end markets (IoT, automotive, 5G infrastructure) can overcome the macro-related headwinds.&nbsp;<ul><li>A couple other semiconductor names that meet this criteria are <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) and <strong>Broadcom</strong> (<strong>AVGO</strong>). On the flip side, AMD has substantial exposure to the PC and laptop end market, explaining why its stock is getting hit harder than most today.</li></ul></li><li>INTL's troubles are compounded by the fact that its progressing through a major transition as it expands its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. Its mission to level the global playing field against<strong> Taiwan Semi</strong> (<strong>TSM</strong>), the world's largest chip maker, is admirable, but it's coming at a hefty cost. Specifically, INTC's margins are taking a significant hit, dipping by 5.7 percentage points in Q1. Looking ahead, INTC expects gross margin to slip further to 51-53% over the next 2-3 years before improving.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that Zinsner's gloomy outlook is seemingly setting the stage for another disappointing earnings report from INTC in late July, but it may not be a red flag for the semiconductor industry as a whole. It's clear that the PC end market is cooling off after the work-at-home transition sparked a revival. This normalization in PC demand, and the ongoing supply chain issues, are hitting at the same time that INTC is heavily investing in domestic manufacturing facilities. These headwinds don't necessarily translate into an upcoming downturn for other semiconductor companies that have rising exposure to high growth end markets, such as automotive, IoT, data center, and 5G infrastructure.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
