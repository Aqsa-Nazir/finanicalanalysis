<html><body><p>Fintech pioneer <strong>PayPal</strong> (<strong>PYPL</strong>) has had a rough year, diving lower by over 50%, but the stock is cruising higher today after making a series of significant announcements. PYPL's mixed Q2 earnings report, which included a modest EPS beat and a miss on total payment volume (TPV), is taking a back seat to news that Elliott Investment Management has taken a $2.0 bln stake in the company. In conjunction with this investment, PYPL also announced a new cost-cutting program that's targeting about $2.2 bln in savings through 2023, as well as a new $15.0 bln share repurchase authorization.<br><br>When business was booming in 2020 and early 2021 due to the pandemic-induced shift towards e-commerce, the focus centered on PYPL's robust growth and potential to expand its active user base. As mobility returned and PYPL's top-line growth trailed off to single-digit levels, investors' attention turned to its cost structure, margins, operating efficiency, and capital allocation strategy. Given Elliott's reputation for instigating productivity improvements through major corporate shake-ups, the enthusiasm for this development is understandable.<br><br>In addition to the cost-cutting initiatives, PYPL also appointed Blake Jorgensen as its new CFO, taking over for John Rainey who left to join Walmart (WMT) in April. Jorgensen has extensive experience in the CFO role, formerly holding that position at <strong>Electronic Arts </strong>(<strong>EA</strong>), <strong>Levi Strauss &amp; Co.</strong> (<strong>LEVI</strong>), and <strong>Yahoo</strong> (<strong>YHOO</strong>).</p><p>Overall, PYPL's Q2 results and guidance show that the company is in need of spark.</p><ul><li>TPV increased by a modest 13% on a FX-neutral basis to $339.8 bln, slightly missing analysts' estimates. TPV growth has steadily eroded, sliding from 24% in 3Q21, to 23% in 4Q21, and then to 15% last quarter.</li><li>Net New Accounts (NNAs) were underwhelming at 0.4 mln, slowing from last quarter's increase of 2.4 mln.</li><li>Operating expenses grew faster than revenue at 17% vs. 9%. Consequently, non-GAAP operating margin plummeted by 738 bps yr/yr to 19.1%.</li><li>PYPL lowered its FY22 revenue growth outlook to $27.85 bln from $28.2-$28.7 bln, reflecting a further slowdown in growth to about 11% on a FX-neutral basis.</li></ul><p>It's evident that the macroeconomic headwinds that CEO Dan Schulman highlighted last quarter, causing him to withdraw PYPL's medium-term outlook, have intensified. Rising competition from buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies like <strong>Affirm</strong> (<strong>AFRM</strong>) and <strong>Block </strong>(<strong>SQ</strong>) have also taken a toll on PYPL. Rather than trying to fight an uphill battle to reignite its top-line growth, the company is wisely prioritizing profitability, margin, expansion, and shareholder returns. With Elliott Investment Management on board, there's a high level of confidence that the company's financial performance will improve, as reflected in its upwardly revised FY22 EPS guidance of $3.87-$3.97.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
