<html><body><p>The intensifying demand concerns that sent shares of <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) spiraling lower in 2022 are fading into the rearview mirror following the EV maker's encouraging 4Q22 earnings report. TSLA beat analysts' EPS estimates, despite a 446 bps contraction in automotive gross margin, but the main story centers on a surge in orders that were sparked by the company's recent price cuts.</p><ul><li>During last night's earnings call, Elon Musk stated that January has so far seen the strongest orders on a year-to-date basis in TSLA's history, and that orders are coming in at almost twice the rate of production.</li><li>Simply put, the price cuts have been far more effective than many had imagined, validating TSLA's strategy to sacrifice margins in the near-term for volume and market share. </li><li>A key aspect of the price cuts is that they made most of TSLA's models eligible for the $7,500 tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. When combined with the price discount, the tax incentive lowered the overall price by over 20% on some models. That's a meaningful decrease that expands TSLA's potential customer base.&nbsp;</li><li>While Musk's gloomy macroeconomic outlook hasn't changed, with the eccentric CEO predicting a painful recession this year, he still expects 2023 to be a strong year for TSLA. </li><li>Officially, the company guided for production of 1.8 mln vehicles this year, equating to yr/yr growth of about 37%. However, Musk revealed that internal projections are targeting production closer to 2.0 mln vehicles and that he wanted to remain conservative with the published guidance due to uncertainties regarding the supply chain and economy. Should TSLA produce 2.0 mln vehicles this year, that would equate to yr/yr growth of 46%.&nbsp;</li><li>Of course, Musk's mission to bring Tesla EVs to the masses will come at a cost: namely, lower margins and profits. We saw this play out in Q4 as operating margin slipped by 120 bps sequentially to 16.0%. </li><li>Looking ahead, more margin compression is likely, but the impact is perhaps not as severe as investors had anticipated. CFO Zachary Krikhorn soothed those worries by stating that FY23 automotive gross margin should remain above 20%.</li><li>Further down the road, the next major growth catalyst is set to unfold in FY24 when the oft-delayed Cybertruck will finally begin mass production at the Austin, TX plant. By that time, it's also possible that margins could be experiencing some relief from lower commodity prices due to slower economic growth.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>There are still plenty of challenges confronting TSLA, including rising competition in China from up-and-coming manufacturers like <strong>BYD Co</strong>. (<strong>BYDDY</strong>) and <strong>NIO</strong> (<strong>NIO</strong>), but the Q4 earnings beat and bullish commentary suggest that fears about slumping demand were mostly overblown.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
