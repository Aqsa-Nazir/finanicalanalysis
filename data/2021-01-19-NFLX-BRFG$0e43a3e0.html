<html><body><p><strong>Netflix (NFLX)</strong> is set to report Q4 results today on its website right at the close with a video call to follow at 6pm ET. Current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus is for EPS to grow 8% yr/yr to $1.41 and for revenue to grow 21% yr/yr to $6.62 bln. In October, NFLX guided to EPS of $1.35 and revenue of $6.572 bln.  </p><ul><li><strong>The most important operating metric with NFLX is global streaming net adds.</strong> NFLX had prepared investors in July to brace for a weak net add number in Q3 because the company said it saw a significant pull-forward of new sub adds in 1H20 due to the pandemic. We, and likely many other investors, felt that NFLX was just being conservative. However, NFLX was spot on and came up a bit light with a final number at 2.20 mln (vs 2.50 mln prior guidance). <ul><li><strong>NFLX guided to Q4 net adds of 6.00 mln</strong>, which we found a bit disappointing since Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter. </li></ul></li><li> In terms of other important metrics, UCAN (US &amp; Canada) ARPU got back on track at $13.40 in Q3 vs $13.08 a year ago and vs $13.25 in Q2. ARPU had taken a dip in Q2 due to a heavy dose of free trials, but it was good to see that metric growing again. Operating margin was another bright spot at 20.4% vs 19.7% prior guidance although NFLX has guided to just 13.5% operating margin in Q4. </li><li><strong>An interesting wrinkle with this report will be how customers responded to Netflix raising prices in Q4 </strong>to $14/mo for its standard plan and $18/mo for the premium tier. That's up from $13/$16. With so many other streaming services on the market, we'll see if US consumers pushed back on this by cancelling subscriptions. </li><li> We have not heard much from NFLX since its Q3 report in October, however, the company tweeted on Jan 4 that holiday viewership represented its "biggest viewing week between Christmas and New Year's ever!" Perhaps that's a signal that the price increases did not have a big impact. </li><li>Bottom line, the EPS miss and particularly the net add miss in Q3 led to a pullback in the stock. However, the stock has since recovered and has been trading mostly sideways in recent months. Finally, a takeaway from NFLX's Q3 report: The company expected a drop-off in net adds in Q3, the market felt NFLX was just being cautious but there wound up being a sizeable drop-off. The lesson learned was that NFLX is not always trying to lowball guidance. (PVIEW)</li></ul><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
