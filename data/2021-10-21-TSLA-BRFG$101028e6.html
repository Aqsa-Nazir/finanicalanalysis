<html><body>Already contending with semiconductor shortages and severe shipping disruptions, rolling blackouts due to an energy crisis in China added another major hurdle for <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) in 3Q21. Incredibly, the electric vehicle (EV) maker continued to steer around most of these roadblocks, delivering yet another strong, upside earnings report that featured a 73% surge in deliveries. As impressive as the delivery growth is, the performance would have been even better had TSLA been able to run its factories at full capacity throughout the quarter.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">While demand remains robust, TSLA's operational efficiency also continues to improve, pushing its automotive gross margin higher by 281 bps yr/yr to 30.5%. The company achieved this despite experiencing a 6% yr/yr drop in average selling prices, while commodity costs also increased. A key factor behind TSLA's rising margins is the ramp up of production at its Shanghai factory. During the earnings conference call, CFO Zack Kirkhorn explained that TSLA's bottom line "continues to benefit from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit with higher fixed cost absorption."<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Looking ahead, Kirkhorn warned that the company's margins could take a hit, though, after it opens its factories in Austin, TX and Germany. These new plants, which are slated to begin production late this year, will take some time to reach the efficiency levels achieved at TSLA's California and Shanghai factories. Adding to the complexity, these plants will be rolling out completely new models -- including the Cybertruck in Austin -- that are built by new manufacturing technologies. <br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">On the topic of Cybertruck, CEO Elon Musk stated that production should start by the end of next year, with volume production anticipated in 2023. That timeline represents a significant push-back from the prior forecast of initial production starting by the end of 2021. Given the current status of the supply chain, and TSLA's prioritization of launching the new Model Y, the delay isn't surprising.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">TSLA doesn't see the supply chain and chip shortage situation improving any time soon. In fact, Musk commented that the supply chain shortages could persist until 2023. Still, the company reiterated its outlook of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. In the near-term, TSLA plans to squeeze out production from its existing facilities, although it is struggling to keep up with demand. Backlogs are continuing to grow, and average customer wait times are extending.<br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Overall, TSLA is executing remarkably well in an extremely challenging environment. It won't get much easier for the company moving forward as <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>), <strong>Ford Motor</strong> (<strong>F</strong>), and others prepare to launch a barrage of new EVs in the coming years. However, as its Q3 results illustrate, TSLA has a proven track record of overcoming challenges and exceeding expectations.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
