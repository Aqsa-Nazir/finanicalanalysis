<html><body><p><strong>eBay (EBAY +7%)</strong> is a hot commodity today after the company reported strong Q4 results and guidance last night. To make matters even better, eBay increased its dividend by 13% to $0.18/share and expanded its share repurchase authorization by $4 bln. </p><p>eBay has a good track record in terms of beating consensus estimates; the company has gone without an EPS miss for the past five years. That trend continued in Q4. However, in typical eBay fashion, the upside was decent at $0.03 but was not a blowout. Revenue showed good upside as well. What really stood out was eBay's huge Q1 guidance for EPS of $1.03-1.08 vs $0.86 consensus and revs of $2.94-2.99 bln vs. $2.54 bln consensus. </p><p> <strong>eBay's core Marketplaces segment has seen a boom in transactions since the pandemic started,</strong> and that trend continued during the holiday Q4 period. Gross merchandise volume and marketplaces grew 18%, well ahead of expectations. The holiday season saw record volume, with high velocity in hard-to-find and sold-out items. Refurbished gifts also emerged as a top trend. eBay saw many products from top brands in its Certified Refurbished experience sell out completely. Buyers were very active during the holiday season. In the US, one in 10 online shoppers bought something on eBay. </p><p> From a broader sense, <strong>eBay has been undergoing a few major changes</strong> of late, including a big change at the top in April 2020, when new CEO Jamie Iannone took the helm. He has a strong ecommerce background; he was most recently COO of <strong>Walmart (WMT) </strong>eCommerce. He has endeavored to focus the company on its core Marketplaces segment and lead eBay's expansion in payments and advertising. </p><p><strong>The company has also been shedding non-core businesses. </strong>In July 2020, the company announced that it would sell its struggling Classifieds unit to Adevinta in a cash and stock deal worth $9.2 bln (deal is expected to close by the end of Q1). In February 2020, eBay closed on its $4 bln sale of its StubHub ticketing businesses to Viagogo, a European rival. Also, in January 2021, eBay announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Korea business. The purpose of these deals is to allow eBay to focus on its core Marketplaces segment. </p><p> On the managed payments front, eBay is making good progress, ending the year with over 1 mln sellers migrated. During Q4, eBay managed payments for over 38% of on-platform volume. In the US, eBay exited the year with over 50% of the migration complete. In 2021, the plan is to rollout payments to additional markets. eBay wants to open up managed payments to all sellers globally. In terms of advertising, Q4 advertising growth outpaced volume once again as sellers leaned further into Promoted Listings to grow their business. </p><p> <strong>Bottom line, investors are clearly happy with these results,</strong> especially the robust guidance for Q1. Big upside guidance is not typical for eBay. Last quarter, the company guided just in-line, so to see this huge upside guidance is a good indication that the changes eBay has been making are the right ones. Investors are also happy to see the Classifieds sale progressing well. Furthermore, the dividend increase and large buyback authorization are signs that management feels confident in its cash flow projections.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
