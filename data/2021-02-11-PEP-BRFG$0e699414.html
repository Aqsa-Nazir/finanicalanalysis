<html><body>During the earlier stages of the pandemic, <strong>PepsiCo's</strong> (<strong>PEP</strong>) two largest segments, Frito Lay North America and PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), produced results that sharply contrasted each other. For instance, in 2Q20, Frito-Lay generated organic revenue growth of 6% compared to a 7% decline for PBNA. While the work-from-home (WFH) transition boosted demand for PEP's snack food brands like Tostitos, Doritos, and Ruffles, the closure of theaters and sports venues, and limited seating capacity at restaurants, pressured the PBNA business.<br><br>Now, the performance of these two segments is evening out as economies begin to reopen. The end result is that PEP is delivering stronger results, evidenced by its upside 4Q20 report. In fact, the company's 8.8% top-line growth represents its highest revenue growth rate in over five years.<br><br>The turnaround in PBNA stands out, highlighted by a 5.5% increase in organic revenue and a 19% jump in operating profit. Productivity savings and cuts in advertising and marketing spend amplified the segment's profitability. Still, there is room for improvement as the foodservice channel continues to struggle, posting another double-digit sales decline this quarter. As vaccines become widely distributed this year, PEP is hopeful that the foodservice market will experience a recovery similar to the rebound currently seen in large format stores.<br><br>Meanwhile, the WFH shift continues to drive solid growth at Frito Lay. Organic revenue growth slipped modestly to 5% from 6% last quarter, fueled again by strength in its large chip brands. One blemish, however, is that operating profit fell by 4%, partly due to higher operating costs. In turn, PEP's overall adjusted operating margin dipped to 12.7% from 13.2% in the year ago quarter.<br><br>Another factor that may be keeping a lid on the stock today is PEP's outlook for 1Q21. Specifically, the company expects low-single digit organic revenue growth, representing a step back from Q4's increase of 5.7%. A key caveat is that the company is lapping a difficult yr/yr comparison as 1Q20 saw a pandemic-induced surge in consumer demand. In that quarter, organic revenue growth jumped by an impressive 7.9%.<br><br>The bigger issue may be that PEP is forecasting another drop in operating margin due to higher costs and mix impacts resulting from international acquisition activity in the year ago period. While the company expects these effects to moderate throughout the year, a theme revolving around rising costs may be hurting investor sentiment.<br><br>On a related note, investors probably weren't too excited to hear that PEP doesn't expect to repurchase more shares in FY21. Beyond the positive effect on EPS, share buybacks buoy investor confidence levels. If PEP believes there are better options to invest its capital other than its stock, some investors may view that as an invitation to look for other opportunities.<br><br>It's a mixed bag overall for PEP, but the main takeaway in our view is that the beverage business is on the upswing and is poised for solid growth when entertainment-based businesses reopen. The snack business should continue to benefit from the WFH transition, but rising costs are a factor to keep an eye on moving forward.<br><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
