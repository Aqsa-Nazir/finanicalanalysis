<html><body>Facing lofty expectations, <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) reported strong Q2 deliveries of 201,250, reaching a new quarterly record in the process, while achieving impressive yr/yr growth of 121%. However, it appears that delivery estimates were around 207,000 vehicles, so TSLA came up just short of analysts' forecasts.&nbsp;<br><br>It's hard to characterize the report as weak, though, when Model 3/Y deliveries rocket higher by 148% yr/yr to 199,360 units. Also, total deliveries are trending higher on a sequential basis, rising from 181,000 in 4Q20, to 184,800 in 1Q21, and finally to the current level just north of 201,000.<br><br>The strong delivery numbers are also a breath of fresh air following a set of negative storylines emanating from China. Earlier this week, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported&nbsp;that China's State Administration for Market Regulation issued a recall for nearly every TSLA vehicle sold in the country. The recall, which involves about 247,000 Model 3s and nearly 39,000 Model Ys, is related to a safety issue concerning the vehicles' autopilot systems. <br><br>The recall news came on the heels of the Chinese government banning TSLA vehicles from entering military instillations, and a widely-circulated demonstration from a TSLA customer during a&nbsp;Shanghai auto show in April. That customer&nbsp;climbed on top of a TSLA vehicle and showed a video of an accident that allegedly resulted from faulty brakes.<br><br>Whether these events are having any effect on TSLA's business in China is unclear. Based on the company's solid Q2 deliveries number, though, it seems that any possible impact is modest, at least for now.<br><br>The emergence of other EV makers in China doesn't appear to be slowing TSLA down much, either. For instance, earlier this morning, <strong>Li Auto</strong> (<strong>LI</strong>) reported that June deliveries soared by 321% to 7,713 vehicles. Yesterday, <strong>Nio</strong> (<strong>NIO</strong>) disclosed that its June deliveries climbed by 116% to 8,083 vehicles. Give the sheer size of the EV market in China, there's plenty of room for several major players. In 2020, 1.3 mln EVs were sold in China, accounting for ~41% of global EV sales. Looking ahead, it's estimated that China will be producing over 8 mln EVs per year by 2028.<br><br>What could be tempering investors' enthusiasm over TSLA's delivery report is that the company fell off the pace needed to meet the full year delivery expectation of 865,000. For 1H21, TSLA delivered about 386,000 vehicles, leaving around 479K in needed deliveries for 2H21. Recall that last year, TSLA really hit the accelerator in Q4, delivering 180,570 vehicles compared to 139,300 in Q3, to essentially meet its aggressive target of 500K deliveries for the year. In other words, it's not unheard of for TSLA to make up lost ground as the calendar approaches year end.<br><br>The main takeaway is that, despite all the recent noise surrounding the company, business is still humming for TSLA. Investors were likely expecting an even stronger deliveries number, explaining why shares aren't reacting more favorably. Beyond the slight deliveries miss, it's hard to be too disappointed with the triple-digit yr/yr growth and 9% sequential growth.&nbsp;<br><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
