<html><body><p><strong>Tesla </strong>(<strong>TSLA</strong>) is charging higher after the company stated its intention to seek shareholder approval for an increase in authorized shares of common stock in order to facilitate a stock split. Notably, the company's Board of Directors has already approved the proposal, paving the way for the stock split to transpire. It's a near certainty that shareholders will vote in favor of the maneuver, especially since the stock's price more than doubled in the four months following TSLA's last stock split on August 31, 2020.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">The vote will take place during TSLA's annual shareholder meeting, but a date for the event has yet to be confirmed. Typically, the company hosts its annual shareholder meeting during the second half of the year. For instance, last year's shareholder meeting took place on October 7, following a September meeting in 2020.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Stock splits have been a hot topic recently. Earlier this month, <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>) made major waves after announcing a long-awaited split (20:1), which has fueled an 18% rally in the stock. Some may understandably question why divvying a stock up into more pieces offered at a lower price is viewed as such a bullish development. After all, a stock split doesn't have any fundamental value or impact on a business, nor does it change the value of one's holdings -- at least not immediately. However, splits do have some merit for other reasons.</p><ul><li>Psychologically, the idea of holding twice as many, or, perhaps five times as many shares, depending on the split, is a powerful force. If the stock were to rally back towards its pre-split price, investors would be sitting pretty. Of course, there's no guarantee that will happen, but the prospect of increasing an investment by a factor of five is a motivating factor to hang onto a holding.</li><li>A lower price also makes an expensive stock like TSLA or AMZN more accessible to a wider swath of investors. Many online brokerages now offer fractional share purchases, so this benefit isn't as meaningful as it once was. Still, some investors may find it more palatable to buy multiple whole shares, rather than half of a share at a much higher price.</li><li>Inclusion in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average becomes a possibility. Interestingly, the auto manufacturing industry isn't currently represented in the Dow after <strong>General Motors'</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>) 83-year run ended in 2008. As auto makers are experiencing a renaissance due to the emergence of electric vehicles (EV), we can envision a company like TSLA, GM, or <strong>Ford Motors</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) earning a place in the historic index sometime down the road.</li></ul><p>Considering the impressive move that TSLA made the last time its stock split, it's easy to understand today's exuberance. In our view, the fact that TSLA's Shanghai factory is fully operational and didn't experience a more prolonged shutdown earlier this month due to COVID is at least equally important news. Without strong fundamentals, such as the red-hot demand environment for EVs in the wake of surging gas prices, a stock split wouldn't mean too much on its own. In the case of TSLA, the split comes at a time when business is booming and as it struggles to keep up with orders.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
