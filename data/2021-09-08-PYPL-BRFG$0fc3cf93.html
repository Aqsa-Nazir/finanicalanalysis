<html><body>The rush to expand buy now, pay later (BNPL) capabilities is on full display again today following <strong>PayPal's</strong> (<strong>PYPL</strong>) acquisition of Japan-based Paidy for approximately $2.7 bln. Fueled by the pandemic-driven surge in e-Commerce activity, BNPL services have soared in popularity among consumers, attracting major FinTechs and retailers alike. Most notably, <strong>Square</strong> (<strong>SQ</strong>) announced its intention to acquire Australia's Afterpay for $29 bln on August 2, followed by news of a blockbuster partnership between <strong>Affirm</strong> (<strong>AFRM</strong>) and <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>) on August 30.<br><br>For PYPL, the addition of Plaidy represents a significant extension of an existing growth strategy. Last year, the company launched its BNPL service and the early results have been quite impressive. Already, over $3.5 bln in total payment volume (TPV) has been generated on PYPL's platform, with 650,000 merchants establishing partnerships with the company. What really illustrates the momentum is that more than $1.5 bln of that $3.5 bln in TPV was processed in Q2 alone.<br><br>By purchasing Plaidy, PYPL is upping the ante and making a major push to take market share in Japan and the APAC region.<br><br>With over six million active users, Plaidy is a sizable company that can move the top-line needle for PYPL. Perhaps most intriguing is that Plaidy is only scratching the surface in terms of its total addressable market. In Japan, adoption of digitally-enabled financial products has been relatively slow compared to many other developed countries. In fact, it's been reported that roughly three quarters of all purchases in Japan are still completed with cash. However, Plaidy's rapid growth shows that Japanese consumers are becoming more comfortable conducting transactions digitally. For more hesitant shoppers, Plaidy offers the option to pay their micro-loans off at select convenience stores.<br><br>This acquisition also comes on the heels of a disappointing Q2 earnings report in late July. Specifically, TPV growth decelerated to 40% from 50% in Q1, while PYPL also issued downside EPS and revenue guidance for Q3 and FY21. The company primarily blamed a faster-than-expected transition to <strong>eBay's</strong> (<strong>EBAY</strong>) in-house payment solution for the soft outlook. It's likely, though, that souring consumer sentiment and a pull-back in travel due to the delta variant also played a role.&nbsp;<br><br>Although the Plaidy acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in FY22, the addition should provide a nice revenue boost. During last quarter's earnings conference call, PYPL noted that cart sizes for those using its BNPL service was higher by 39% on average. As Plaidy becomes integrated into PYPL, this factor should help drive strong merchant growth and higher payment volume.<br><br>After initially popping higher following the announcement, shares of PYPL have drifted lower along with the broader market. Lackluster price action aside, we view the Plaidy acquisition favorably as PYPL takes a major step in expanding its red-hot BNPL business.<br><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
