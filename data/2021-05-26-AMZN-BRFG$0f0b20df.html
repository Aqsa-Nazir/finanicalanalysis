<html><body><p>The streaming wars are heating up. <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> announced this morning that it will acquire privately held MGM (the movie studio, not the casino) and its iconic lion roar for $8.45 bln. This was AMZN's second largest acquisition ever, behind Whole Foods a few years ago, so it's a big deal. The acquisition was not a complete surprise as the WSJ had been reporting over the past few days that a deal was imminent, but now it's official. </p><p><strong>What does this deal mean for the streaming world?</strong> </p><ul><li><strong>Amazon's Prime Video offering will add a lot of content</strong> given that Metro Goldwyn Mayer is a huge studio in Hollywood and has been around a long time. Its vast library contains 4,000+ films, including James Bond, Legally Blonde, Creed, Rocky, Thelma &amp; Louise etc. It also includes 17,000 TV shows, including The Handmaid's Tale, Fargo, and Vikings. </li><li><strong>We do not think it's a coincidence</strong> that this deal was announced so soon after <strong>AT&amp;T (T) </strong>announced it would combine its WarnerMedia assets, including HBO Max, with <strong>Discovery's (DISCA)</strong> entertainment and sports businesses to create a massive streaming service as a standalone company to compete better with <strong>Netflix (NFLX) </strong>and <strong>Disney+ (DIS)</strong>. The message is clear: build massive amounts of content. </li><li> <strong>We think the deal is also perhaps a realization by Amazon that it will not be able to produce enough content on its own</strong> quickly enough to compete effectively. It does not want to be left behind by its streaming competitors. </li><li> This deal along with the AT&amp;T/Discovery<strong> deal tells us that Netflix's recent stumbles on its net sub add growth is not a long-term concern</strong> about market saturation. The long-term dynamics for streaming look great and these deals show that big media companies agree. </li></ul><p><strong>Whenever AMZN gets involved, you better watch out.</strong> What we find interesting is that when Amazon launched its Amazon Restaurants, investors rightly feared the impact that would have on <strong>GrubHub (GRUB), DoorDash (DASH)</strong> and others. However, AMZN did not seem to subsequently push into that space aggressively, probably because it saw that it was highly saturated and very cutthroat in terms of pricing. We see the MGM deal as AMZN turning up the heat on streaming and it's a sign that it plans to attack this market. We would not be surprised to see Amazon make other deals and increase spending on content production. </p><p><strong>We also think this deal warrants a tip of the cap to Netflix.</strong> It has been building its content and producing its own shows and movies for years, long before streaming became cool. NFLX was heavily criticized at the time for spending too much on production, but looking back, it was clearly the right move. NFLX has not had to resort to M&amp;A. Most of its content creation has been organic and it had a huge head start. Now NFLX is the 800 lb. gorilla in the streaming space and other media companies are envious of that massive and recurring revenue stream. They are trying to play catch up.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
