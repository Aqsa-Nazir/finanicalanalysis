<html><body><p>As if life was not tough enough already for retail drug store chains <strong>Walgreens (WBA -9%) </strong>and <strong>CVS Health (CVS -8%), Amazon (AMZN)</strong> today <a bhref="https://www.briefing.com/InPlayEq/NewsFeed/newsdoc?id=789396" target="_blank">announced</a> two new pharmacy offerings: </p><ul><li>Amazon Pharmacy allows customers to purchase prescriptions online, and Prime members receive unlimited, free two-day delivery. Users can input insurance info. </li><li>For people without insurance, AMZN is allowing Prime members to receive discounts of up to 80% off generics and 40% off brand name meds.  </li></ul><p>That AMZN is jumping into the prescription business with both feet is not completely surprising. Recall that Amazon purchased PillPack in 2018. PillPack will remain a distinct service for customers who take multiple daily meds and prefer pre-sorted dose packaging. But today's news goes beyond that. What jumps out to us is the free delivery for Prime customers, which makes its service very attractive for existing Prime members and makes it hard for competing online pharmacy companies to pry away those customers. Also, AMZN seems to be going all-in in terms of using its massive scale to bend prices lower for people without insurance.  </p><p><strong>How does this affect competitors?</strong> </p><ul><li><strong>Drug store chains (WBA, CVS, RAD)</strong> were already getting squeezed by lower reimbursement rates and by a creeping amount of online pharmacy competition, but AMZN's move feels like a real step on the gas pedal. Furthermore, these chains have already been hurt by online competitors (TGT, WMT) for front of store retail items, and now their scripts segment is getting attacked as well. </li><li><strong>PBMs (CAH, MCK, ABC)</strong>: AMZN has been aiming to cut PBMs (middlemen) out of the drug sales pipeline by contracting directly with health plans and employers. Today's news could lead to lost accounts for PBMs or could at least add a healthy dose of margin/pricing pressure as AMZN uses its scale to reduce the need for PBMs and create a direct line from drug manufacturers to consumers. </li><li><strong>Online pharmacy providers</strong> like GDRX will be hurt because AMZN is going after their best sales pitch: drug pricing transparency. AMZN will make it easy for customers to compare and choose their lowest price option. The online space has already gotten crowded with <strong>UnitedHealth (UNH)</strong> buying DivvyDose and <strong>Uber Health (UBER)</strong> partnering with NimbleRx, but AMZN's entry/scale and its free delivery make it even tougher for the competition. </li></ul><p>Overall, Amazon has that feel that it's taking over the world. Today's move by Amazon is certain to shake up the prescription drug industry for years to come.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
