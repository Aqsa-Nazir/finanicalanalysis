<html><body>For the fifth consecutive quarter, <strong>Adobe</strong> (<strong>ADBE</strong>) surpassed analysts' EPS forecast by a double-digit amount ($3.03 vs. $2.82), demonstrating once again that the company is at the forefront of the digital transformation. <br><br>Although ADBE's growth rate slightly decelerated from last quarter's 26% to 23% in Q2, business remains quite healthy. The company continues to benefit from key trends that emerged and accelerated during the pandemic.<br><br>In the company's core Digital Media segment (~73% of Q2 revenue), revenue climbed by 25%, exceeding its expectation for growth of 21%. This segment houses ADBE's flagship Creative Cloud offering as well as the Document Cloud business.<br><br>Creative Cloud offers a set of cloud-based products for designing, creating, and publishing content, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom. Remote working and learning have fueled an explosion in content creation as employees and students rapidly shift to digital platforms to share work and to visually connect with employers, customers, students, and professors. Bolstered by the work and learn from home transition, Creative Cloud revenue grew 24% yr/yr to $2.32 bln.<br><br>Similar to DocuSign (DOCU), ADBE's Document Cloud business (Acrobat, PDF products) has experienced an upswing as people create, share, sign, and send an increasing number of documents digitally. The sharp cutback in business travel made solutions like Document Cloud a necessity for many enterprises, as evidenced by Document Cloud's strong growth over the past few quarters. After jumping by 32% last quarter, Document Cloud revenue increased by 30% in Q2.<br><br>ADBE's other segment, Digital Experience, is also performing well, with revenue up 21%. This business focuses on digital marketing, advertising, and analytics, adding another layer to digital-related growth catalysts. However, unlike the Digital Media segment, it hasn't been smooth sailing for this business over the past several quarters. The company has been winding down its lower-margin Advertising Cloud offering in order to focus on higher-growth opportunities in data collection, analysis, and AI-enabled products. <br><br>As a result, revenue growth faced a headwind last year, as illustrated by the tepid subscription revenue growth of 7% in 3Q20. With this initiative now in the rearview mirror, though, growth is perking up. <br><br>Looking ahead, ADBE expects its momentum to continue, forecasting Q3 Digital Media segment growth of 22% and Digital Experience growth of 21%. It's worth noting that ADBE has a recent history of exceeding its guidance, so these projections may prove to be conservative.<br><br>Overall, the main story hasn't changed much from the last several quarters, and that's a good thing. ADBE is perfectly positioned to capitalize on digital transformation trends, and we don't see that changing any time soon.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
