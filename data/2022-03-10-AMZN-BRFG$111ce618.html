<html><body><p><strong>Amazon (AMZN +5%) </strong>is trading higher today after the company announced a 20-for-1 stock split and a $10 bln buyback authorization. In our view, this announcement was long overdue; it is a change for which investors have been clamoring. Big names like <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> and <strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong> finally split their shares in 2020; Amazon, however, was a holdout. AMZN split its stock twice in 1999 during the Internet heyday, but this will be its first split since. </p><ul><li>Of course, it's true that a stock split will not alter the total value of shares an investor owns. Holdings can be thought of like pizza: cut into smaller pieces, the pizza's total quantity remains the same. On the other hand, smaller pieces may be easier to share and to digest than larger pieces. </li><li><strong>All kidding aside,</strong> <strong>a stock split may seem like a gimmick, but it matters, </strong>especially for smaller, retail investors, including as a psychological consideration. To spend nearly $3,000 for each share is untenable for many smaller investors, and such a price is frankly not as enticing as a $150 stock price. </li><li><strong>We wonder how instrumentally Andy Jassy's ascension to CEO</strong> last July produced the decision to at last to split the stock. Also, the stock had already been underperforming other tech names even before the tech selloff of 2022, and so far this year, it has trended lower. We have to assume that AMZN's management has been frustrated that the share price has stalled since July 2020, mostly trading sideways. A stock split may help the stock find new momentum. </li><li>While a $10 bln buyback authorization does sound substantial, for a company with $1.5 trillion market cap, it's a drop in the bucket. It nevertheless makes for a welcome headline, but we wish it would have been larger. </li></ul><p><strong>We wonder if this split could make AMZN a possible candidate for future addition to the Dow 30.</strong> Unlike most indices, the Dow 30 is price-weighted and not market cap-weighted. For that reason, a company with a $3,000 stock price cannot belong to the index because it would disturb the balance. A $150 stock price, however, is very appropriate. Apple announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014 and was added to the Dow 30 in 2015; we'll see if lightning strikes twice. </p><p><strong>Bottom line, we have been waiting for this day for a long time.</strong> We hope that this news spurs other highly priced stocks like <strong>Alphabet (GOOG), Booking Holdings (BKNG), </strong>and <strong>Chipotle (CMG)</strong> to consider splits of their own. Mark calendars for June 6, as that is when the stock is expected to start trading at the split-adjusted price. Overall, we think the split and buyback are positive headlines that may have the potential to kick the stock into higher gear.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
