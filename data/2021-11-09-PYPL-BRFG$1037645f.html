<html><body>Digital payment processing giant <strong>PayPal </strong>(<strong>PYPL</strong>) has missed revenue estimates and provided downside quarterly guidance in back-to-back quarters, producing fears that its recent woes run deeper than a faster-than-expected unwinding of its <strong>eBay</strong> (<strong>EBAY</strong>) business. While it was unrealistic to expect PYPL to maintain the exceptional level of performance achieved during the height of the pandemic, the magnitude of the drop-off is catching investors off-guard. In particular, an unexpected shift back to brick-and-mortar shopping due to a loss of confidence in shipping, and a more profound effect from the conclusion of stimulus checks, is weakening the online shopping trend that accelerated last year. <br><br>The news isn't all bad, as PYPL also announced a blockbuster agreement with <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>) that&nbsp;enables U.S. customers to pay with PYPL's Venmo at checkout. However, this development is being overshadowed by rising growth concerns as the company wrestles against macroeconomic and competitive headwinds.<br><br>PYPL's top-line miss can be tied back to a deceleration in Total Payment Volume (TPV) growth, which increased by 26% to $310 mln, falling short of the $313 bln forecast. More troubling than the miss, though, is that TPV was essentially flat qtr/qtr, after jumping by 9% last quarter. A 45% plunge in EBAY-related transactions certainly didn't help, but CEO Dan Shulman also cited weaker consumer confidence (lack of stimulus, shipping issues) and supply chain shortages within the merchant base as major impediments.&nbsp;<br><br>A source of strength continues to be Venmo, PYPL's person-to-person digital payment platform. For the quarter, Venmo processed a staggering $60 bln in TPV, up 36% yr/yr, putting the app on track to deliver $900 mln in revenue this year. It appears that the company has only scratched the surface so far regarding Venmo's growth potential. The partnership with AMZN is exciting, elevating Venmo from more of a social-oriented payment system that's often used to pay individuals or small local businesses, to one that's used far more broadly. It also serves to replace the lost EBAY business, at terms that Shulman says are much more favorable. In fact, Shulman stated that Pay with Venmo is "probably going to be the biggest revenue source going forward."<br><br>Another primary component of PYPL's growth strategy is the expansion of its buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform. Recall that in early September, the company purchased Japan-based Paidy for $2.7 bln, complementing the launch of its BNPL services last year. The deal, which closed in October, will expand PYPL's presence in the APAC region, building upon the $5.4 bln in TPV that the BNPL platform has processed since last year's launch.&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of growth catalysts, PYPL has a few irons in the fire. The problem, however, is that the aforementioned headwinds are more persistent than anticipated, causing the company to lower its already downgraded FY21 outlook. After issuing downside FY21  guidance last quarter, forecasting EPS of $4.70 and revenue growth of ~20%, PYPL is now projecting EPS of $4.60 and revenue growth of ~18%. <br><br>The main takeaway is that PYPL has transitioned into a slower growth period after enjoying a boom during the pandemic-fueled digital shopping frenzy. Business is still relatively healthy, though, and the new Venmo arrangement with AMZN looks like a game-changer. Today's weakness simply reflects an adjustment from the lingering sky-high growth expectations that emanated during the pandemic, to a more cautious view that considers the intensifying macro-related pressures.<br><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
