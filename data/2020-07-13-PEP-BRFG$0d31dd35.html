<html><body><strong>PepsiCo</strong> (<strong>PEP</strong>) is kicking off the 2Q20 earnings season in solid fashion, reporting core EPS and revenue comfortably ahead of analysts' expectations. Like last quarter, the packaged food giant experienced healthy demand in its Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods businesses. On an organic sales basis, revenue increased by 6% and 23%, respectively, in those two segments. <br><br>The strong results were mainly driven by the remote working shift, which is causing more people to eat at home. In particular, since many employees are not picking up breakfast on the way to work, PEP's breakfast brands (Quaker, Life, recently-retired brand name Aunt Jemima) are drawing more demand.<br><br>In addition to the favorable business conditions, CEO Ramon Laguarta noted that the company gained market share in the snack food business this quarter.<br><br>When PEP reported Q1 earnings on April 28, Mr. Laguarta cautioned that sales in the retail channel were likely to soften as buying habits normalize and as businesses reopen. The anticipation for slower growth in PEP's snack and breakfast businesses may help explain why the stock is marginally lower since its Q1 report.<br><br>However, based on PEP's Q2 results, it appears that the eat-at-home and food stockpiling trends have more lasting power than originally expected. Furthermore, rising virus cases and government roll-backs of reopening plans should keep demand sturdy as employees continue to work from home.<br><br>On the flip-side, PEP's beverage business continues to struggle. Due to restaurant and theater closures and sporting and entertainment event cancellations, revenue in its North America beverage segment fell by 7%. The good news for PEP is that its away-from-home exposure is relatively light at about 10-20% of total sales. By comparison, rival <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> (<strong>KO</strong>) generates roughly 40-50% of sales from the away-from-home channel.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, PEP did not update its earnings or revenue expectations for FY20. In its Q1 earnings report, PEP removed its FY20 guidance given the uncertainties associated with the virus. <br><br>The company did reaffirm its intention to return $7.5 bln in capital to shareholders this fiscal year, via $5.5 bln in dividends and $2.0 bln in share repurchases. On May 5, PEP increased its quarterly dividend by 7% to $1.0225/share. This is especially notable since many companies have reduced, or eliminated, quarterly dividends this year.<br><br>The main story from last quarter continued into this quarter. Healthy demand in PEP's Frito-Lay and Quaker segments remained intact, offsetting headwinds in the beverage unit. The company also continues to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which should help support the stock during these uncertain times.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
