<html><body><p><strong>PepsiCo (PEP +2%) </strong>is bubbling today after beating Q2 earnings and revs and raising FY21 guidance. After recording slim earnings beats and mild revenue growth over the past few quarters, PEP took a massive crunch out of Q2, reporting double-digit revenue growth for the first time in five years and delivering an out-of-character double-digit earnings beat. </p><p>PEP is typically considered a slow-growing, relatively safe dividend stock that carries attractive valuations (current P/E ratio is 27.7x and EV/EBITDA is 18.5x). So when the beverage and snack food company posts such substantial growth numbers, it can come as quite a surprise. Even last quarter, when the company was lapping lockdowns, revenue still only grew by single digits. </p><p><strong>What changed this quarter? </strong></p><ul><li>An important factor has to do with the foodservice industry's move toward re-opening its doors and lifting capacity restrictions. PepsiCo Beverages North America (NA) is PEP's largest segment by revenue at about 32%. This segment saw foodservice revenue double yr/yr. Furthermore, its second-largest segment, Frito-Lay NA, experienced healthy double-digit revenue growth. This is quite the difference from Q1, when PEP's foodservice revenue declined by double-digits in its Beverages NA segment and Frito-Lay NA segment. </li><li>International divisions also saw solid revenue growth, even though many countries continued to have various COVID-related restrictions in place. The standout internationally was organic revenue in PEP's Beverages business, which jumped 22% yr/yr. To put this into perspective, in Q1, international organic growth was 3% yr/yr and 14% over two years.  However, there was a stale chip in Q2. PEP's Quaker Foods NA segment declined yr/yr as mobility increased. </li><li>However, this is PEP's smallest segment by revenue (~3%). Although PEP is predicting that this segment will continue to decline, with such a small impact on its top line, we do not think the increasing mobility shift should have much material impact. </li><li> Looking ahead, PEP continues to see the foodservice industry improving, especially as travel, education, and entertainment trends accelerate. Although PEP is no exception to experiencing impact from the rise in global inflation, its cost management strategy, first implemented in 2019, is still going strong and is expected to save the company $1 bln annually through 2026, which should help to offset inflationary trends. <ul><li> As such, PEP increased its FY21 earnings and organic revenue guidance to $6.20/share and 6%, respectively. This is up slightly from high single-digit earnings growth and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. </li></ul></li></ul><p> Bottom line, PEP posted a robust quarter with unprecedented revenue growth. In our view, international revenue growth comes as a surprise given the various restrictions still in place and the shaky economic recoveries in these regions. With a steadily increasing dividend over the past 20 years and a robust share repurchase program, PEP remains an attractive choice for buy-and-hold type investors, especially after such a strong Q2.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
