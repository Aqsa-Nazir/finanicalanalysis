<html><body><p><strong>PepsiCo's (PEP)</strong> headline numbers popped in Q2, registering a double-digit earnings beat, solid revenue upside, and raised FY22 organic revenue guidance. Additionally, despite increased levels of inflation persisting across PEP's markets, as well as negative FX impacts, the company's price hikes and cost-saving strategies alleviated much of the pressure, giving management the confidence to reaffirm its FY22 earnings guidance of $6.63. </p><p> So why are investors not reacting even more positively today? We think it may have to do with PEP only reaffirming its FY22 EPS outlook despite sizeable outperformance in Q2. Along with continual FX impacts, PEP is incorporating the likelihood that inflation will increase in the back half of the year. </p><ul><li>Turning to Q2 results, adjusted EPS climbed 10% yr/yr to $1.86, assisted by solid 13% organic top-line growth. Like Q1, organic revs were fueled by broad-based strength. However, the standouts were Latin America and Africa, the Middle East, &amp; South Asia, which both saw sales above 20% yr/yr. </li><li>  Even though sales were strong, volume growth was fairly weak in North America. Only PEP's Quaker business saw volumes increase yr/yr and by just 2%. Meanwhile, Frito-Lay and Beverages declined by 2% and 1%, respectively. Still, it is worth pointing out that on a two-year basis, volume growth was positive across the board.</li><li>  One item that stood out to us is that PEP's convenience channels remained stable even with prices soaring at the pump. The company did comment that there was a slight drop-off in volume offset by a minor increase in price during the quarter. Still, beverage and snack sales have remained in the high-single digits, displaying both categories' defensiveness. <ul><li> On a side note, convenience revenue stabilization bodes well for companies with significant portions of their overall sales stemming from snacks and beverages, such as <strong>Casey's General (CASY)</strong>, <strong>Weis Markets (WMK)</strong>, and <strong>TravelCenters of America (TA)</strong>. </li></ul></li><li>PEP's strong Q2 numbers culminated in its raised FY22 organic sales outlook. The company expects organic revenue growth of +10% yr/yr, up from its prior prediction of +8%. </li></ul><p> <strong>Overall, PEP's Q2 results demonstrate its ability to grow during an inflationary and geopolitically uncertain environment</strong> currently dampening consumer sentiment. PEP noted that it sets its sights on expanding its snacks and beverages categories in any circumstance. Despite a challenging economic backdrop, we believe it is doing a solid job of that through the first half of the year. </p><p> <strong>Nevertheless, it is important to note that as a defensive, consistent dividend-paying stock, PEP currently trades at a relatively pricey multiple of 25x forward earnings, which could limit its upside going forward</strong>. In the current market environment, investors are placing a premium on stocks boasting a defensive profile while providing a consistent dividend. By comparison, <strong>Coca-Cola (KO)</strong> and <strong>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP)</strong>, which report Q2 earnings on July 26 and 28, trade at 25x and 21x forward earnings, respectively.    </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
