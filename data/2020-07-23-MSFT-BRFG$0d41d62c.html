<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> <a bhref="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2020-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank">reported</a> another solid beat, and yet the stock trades modestly lower. That response makes sense if you dig into the quarter a bit. </p><ul><li>In terms of revenue, MSFT did quite well overall, reporting upside relative to prior guidance in two of its three segments - Intelligent Cloud (IC) and More Personal Computing (MPC) - while Productivity and Business Processes' (PBP) result was in-line.<ul><li> A slight negative is that growth rates declined from MarQ in PBP (15% to 6%) and IC (27% to 17%). Offsetting that was MPC (+3% to +14%), which saw an acceleration as Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefitted from more people at home. </li></ul></li><li>In terms of EPS, MSFT broke its string of double digit EPS beats at five in a row. The $0.08 upside this quarter was good, but it was not quite as robust as the beats delivered in recent quarters. </li><li>Probably more troubling was a modest degradation in growth in several key areas: <ul><li>Most prominently, in MSFT's Azure cloud computing business, its crown jewel, growth slowed a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. </li><li>Office Commercial products and cloud services slowed to +5% from +13% in MarQ. </li><li>IC Server products and cloud services slowed to +19% in JunQ from +30% in MarQ. </li><li>LinkedIn growth slowed to +10% in JunQ from +21% in MarQ, as it was impacted by a weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. </li><li>Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. </li><li>Transactional license purchasing continued to slow, particularly in small and medium businesses. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall, this was still a very good quarter, with a solid beat on revenue and EPS. The primary culprits for the stock's move lower, we think, is lackluster PBP segment growth coupled with Azure's performance. While Azure had great growth, with so many companies and consumers using the cloud as they work/learn from home, the Azure number was a slight letdown. This may be a slight cause for concern for Amazon (AMZN) and its rival AWS unit, which reports on July 30.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
