<html><body>Facing a severe chip shortage that has forced major automakers like <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>) and <strong>Ford</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) to idle assembly lines, <strong>Tesla</strong> (<strong>TSLA</strong>) delivered 1Q21 results that easily surpassed analysts' top and bottom-line estimates. Thanks to some shrewd maneuvering, including the quick development of new firmware to assimilate with chips made by new suppliers, TSLA successfully navigated around the supply chain disruptions to generate a 76% surge in production to 180,338 electric vehicles (EVs). In turn, revenue jumped by 74% to $10.39 bln vs. the $9.89 bln expectation.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">TSLA has also become more efficient at building EVs. The construction of new factories, which have greatly increased TSLA's scale, and the launch of new products have helped lower the average cost per vehicle. With average selling prices declining by 13% this quarter following an 11% dip in Q4, the enhanced efficiency is vital to the company's improved profitability. For the quarter, automotive gross margin increased by 95 bps yr/yr to 26.5%, bolstering the 304% surge in EPS to $0.93 vs. the $0.73 consensus estimate.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The upside EPS and revenue figures don't tell the whole story, though. A closer look at TSLA's financials reveal that the company's earnings were significantly boosted by two items that aren't core to its operating activities. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Similar to prior quarters, the company sold a substantial amount of regulatory credits to other auto makers. By exceeding emissions and fuel economy standards, TSLA earns government tax credits that can be sold to its competitors. During Q1, sales of regulatory credits jumped by 46% yr/yr to $518 mln. A major concern is that TSLA may not be able to rely as heavily on these sales in the future as other auto makers ramp up EV production numbers.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Additionally, TSLA partially cashed in on its high-profile $1.5 bln purchase of Bitcoin during Q1. With the leading cryptocurrency doubling in value in Q1, TSLA took some profits off the table by unloading ~10% of its holding. In turn, the company registered a $100 mln gain, goosing the bottom-line in the process.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another issue that may be keeping a lid on shares is that TSLA didn't offer a more specific forecast for FY21 deliveries. The company simply stated that it expects 50% annual growth in deliveries over a multi-year horizon but that it also anticipates stronger growth in some years, including in FY21. With deliveries up 109% in Q1, it's a near certainty that TSLA will comfortably exceed the 50% growth benchmark this year. The issue, though, is that the ongoing chip shortage problem may hold TSLA back from reaching its full growth potential. Last night, CEO Elon Musk commented that he expects the shortages to continue to impact the company in Q2 and Q3. This statement may have some wondering whether the workarounds that TSLA implemented in Q1 will lose some effect moving forward.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There are several moving pieces that are driving the company's financial results, including the company's rapid expansion in the energy storage and residential solar panel businesses. No longer an afterthought, these segments are starting to move the needle in a more pronounced way, as energy storage deployments grew by 71% yr/yr and as solar roof deployments grew by 9x yr/yr. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The bottom line is that TSLA executed well in a very challenging environment and that its growth prospects remain bright due to the rising popularity of EVs and its burgeoning energy-related businesses. While its performance wasn't quite as strong as the headline numbers suggest, we believe that some profit-taking is also in play today following the stock's ~20% gain since late March.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
