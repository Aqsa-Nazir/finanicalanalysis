<html><body><p>Semiconductor powerhouse <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) is rallying and providing a lift to the technology sector after raising its Q4 guidance and announcing the appointment of Pat Gelsinger as its new CEO, effective February 15, 2021. The good news is a welcomed development for INTC, which has been beset by significant production issues with its new 7 nm chip, plunging chip sales in its Data Center Group (DCG), and rising pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb to evaluate strategic alternatives.<br><br>Based on the stock's bullish reaction, it's apparent that investors are pleased with INTC's CEO choice. As the CEO of <strong>VMware</strong> (<strong>VMW</strong>) for the past eight years, he certainly has the pedigree to effectively lead a company of INTC's stature. By bringing in an executive from VMW, the appointment of Gelsinger also signals that INTC's focus will center on higher growth cloud computing and mobile computing/remote working opportunities.&nbsp;<br><br>Gelsinger replaces Bob Swan, who had been CEO since January 2019. During Swan's tenure, INTC's stock badly lagged the broader market, gaining ~8% compared to a ~45% surge in the S&amp;P 500. In 1H20, the company did generate impressive financial results, highlighted by 23.5% revenue growth in 1Q20 and 19.5% growth in 2Q20. Enterprises' accelerating transition to cloud storage systems and the  surge in demand for PCs due to the work-from-home push created a strong tailwind.<br><br>However, the company's performance and execution has been spotty over the past couple of years. The ongoing manufacturing delays for its next-generation 7 nm chip have dealt a blow to investors' confidence, triggering calls for the company to possibly outsource production to a third party foundry.<br><br>In today's press release, INTC provided an encouraging update on this issue, stating it has made "strong progress" on its 7 nm process technology. Gelsinger, who once served as Chief Technology Office of INTC, will be tasked with correcting the production troubles.</p><p>Following a subpar Q3 in which the DCG experienced a 10% revenue decline due to a 47% plunge in enterprise and government sales, it appears that conditions have improved just as Gelsinger takes the helm. INTC now sees Q4 EPS greater than $1.10 vs. its prior guidance of $1.10, on revenue of more than $17.40 bln vs. its former forecast of approximately $17.40 bln.<br><br>The company's brighter outlook comes on the heels of <strong>Micron's</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>) impressive 1Q21 report and guidance on January 7, providing another indicator that demand for semiconductors is on the rise.&nbsp;<br><br>One semiconductor stock that is not moving higher today is INTC rival <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>). The drop in AMD is presumably because investors are now anticipating better execution from INTC, resulting in tougher competition for AMD.<br><br>For INTC investors, today's news is sparking some optimism that stronger growth and more consistent execution is on the near-term horizon.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
