<html><body>A wave of M&amp;A activity is sweeping through the market as companies look to capitalize on rising valuations for their assets, brands, and stock prices. One deal that's capturing plenty of headlines today is <strong>PepsiCo's</strong> (<strong>PEP</strong>) sale of Tropicana, Naked, and other North American juice brands to private equity firm PAI Partners. The deal will net PEP $3.3 bln in pre-tax cash proceeds while also enabling the company to participate in the divested brands' financial performance through a 39% interest in a new joint venture. Additionally, PEP will retain exclusive U.S. distribution rights to the small-format and foodservice channels for these brands.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Coming off one of its strongest quarterly performances in years, highlighted by 20.5% yr/yr top-line growth for Q2, PEP is parlaying its momentum into an opportunity to fetch an attractive price for its Tropicana and juice brands. Although the company didn't break out specific growth rates for each brand, PepsiCo Beverage North America's (PBNA) impressive Q2 organic revenue growth of 21% suggests that strength was broad-based across product lines. In fact, during the earnings conference call, CEO Ramon Laguarta commented that the juice category gained share during the quarter as large format and convenience stores continued to recover.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Given that the juice business is on the upswing, some may wonder why PEP would want to sell it. There are a few main factors behind PEP's decision.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Most importantly, shedding the juice business will allow PEP to center its growth strategies and capital on products that it believes have greater growth potential. Specifically, the company has been expanding and increasing its presence in the energy drink, zero-calorie beverages, and healthier snack categories. For a couple recent example of these efforts, PEP recently launched Mtn Dew Rise Energy while also funneling capital towards the relaunch of its Rockstar portfolio.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Going hand-in-hand with this product optimization notion, PEP is also looking to enhance its margins. According to PEP, the juice business generated operating margin that was below the company's overall operating margin in 2020. It's also worth pointing out that while PEP delivered strong Q2 results in mid-July, its core gross profit margin slipped by 180 bps yr/yr. Some of the decline was related to unfavorable product mix, although it's unclear exactly what products were to blame.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another positive aspect of the deal is that PEP intends to use the cash proceeds to shore up its balance sheet. The company has a considerable amount of long-term debt, with obligations of $38.0 bln as of June 12, 2021. PEP can't make a major dent in that balance with the proceeds from this divestiture, but a small reduction would incrementally lower its interest payments, providing a bump to the bottom line. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The main takeaway is that the timing for PEP to shed its Tropicana and juice brands looks ideal and that a slimmed down product portfolio makes sense, in our view. Its investments will not be spread as thinly across different brands, enabling PEP to better realize the growth potential of its stronger brands. Simultaneously, the company's margin profile should also improve.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
